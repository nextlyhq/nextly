A Single read now applies field-level `access.read` rules before its field-level `afterRead` hooks, and again after them, the way a collection read always has. Before, a denied field's own hook ran and saw the value, and a hook on an allowed sibling could read the denied value; the response was redacted, but app code had already seen it. A Single's document-level access rule still judges the assembled document with denied values present, so a rule written to inspect one keeps working.
