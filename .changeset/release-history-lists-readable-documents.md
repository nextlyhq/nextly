A release's history lists only the documents the reader may read, as the release's document list does: an event about a document the reader may not read is left out, while events about the release itself stay whole. A run's write of a release document takes the release's lock and is refused when the document is no longer in the release, so a document whose release was deleted, or which was taken out of its release, while the run was writing it is left as it was. A person's name in a release's history is read under their account's lock, so a deleted account's name is erased from it like the rest of their events.

Publish now on a release already due now records its `release-publish-now` event, and refuses an API key's scope passed without its `apiKeyId` before running anything, as Publish now on any other release does. The `committed` delete refusal now says that a cancelled release that never began publishing can then be deleted. All of this is experimental until the releases redesign is complete.
