`migrate:baseline --adopt-unknown` adopts a translation table holding columns your config no longer describes.

Without the flag, adoption still refuses: such a column has no field stating what it holds, and the logical kind is what decides its column type, so it cannot be rendered from config at all. Adopting anyway would record a table shape the database does not have, and a rebuilt environment would come up missing translations.

With it, the companion is rebuilt from the database instead of from config, reproducing every column exactly as it stands along with its composite key and its cascading foreign key. The columns simply have no field reading them.
