**Breaking for installs that process images:** `sharp` is now an optional peer dependency. If you upload images and want thumbnails or configured image sizes, run `npm install sharp`.

It was a hard dependency of `nextly`, so every install downloaded it: about 18 MB per platform, almost all of it the native libvips binaries. A site with no image uploads, or one using external images, never executed a line of it. Installs that do process images add one command.

A missing `sharp` now DEGRADES instead of failing. Uploads still succeed and files are still stored; they simply arrive with no thumbnail, no dimensions and no resized copies. Upload security is unchanged, because the check that guards uploads is magic-byte based and never used `sharp`.

This also fixes a defect that would have made the change unusable. `isValidImage` reported "not an image" whenever it could not run, and the upload route refuses on that with `400 Invalid image file`. An install without the package would therefore have rejected every image upload while blaming the user's file. Image validity now reports three states rather than two, and only a positive finding that a buffer is not an image can refuse an upload.

The Image Sizes settings page says when the server cannot process images, and names the command that fixes it, so configured sizes that can never be generated no longer fail silently.

Hosts whose bundler cannot resolve a native module can supply the library directly with `setSharp(sharp)` instead of relying on resolution.
