Read rules that narrow by a filter are now applied in full. A stored read rule can return a filter describing which rows the caller may see, and only part of it was being applied: the first field's `equals` value. A rule naming two fields filtered by one of them, a rule using any other operator applied nothing at all, and a rule whose value was legitimately falsy — `0`, `false`, an empty string — also applied nothing. In each of those cases the read returned rows the rule was written to exclude, and the matching count reported them too.

Filters now go through the same translation your own `where` clauses use, so every field and every supported operator binds. Owner-only rules are unaffected: a single non-empty owner id was the one shape the old path handled correctly, which is why this went unnoticed.

A filter is applied only if **all** of it can be applied. If any part cannot be — an operator that needs a different query path, or a field that is not on the table — the read is refused rather than run under a weaker filter that binds some parts and drops others. The refusal is reported as forbidden, and the matching count refuses identically.
