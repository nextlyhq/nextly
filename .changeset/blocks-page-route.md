`createBlocksPage()` turns a collection of block documents into rendered pages.

It composes the existing content-route factory with the block renderer: the route resolves a path to an entry and owns `generateStaticParams`, `generateMetadata` and the not-found decisions, and this fills in the render. Media ids and entry references resolve against the CMS, so images and links work without wiring either by hand.

```tsx
const { ContentPage, generateMetadata, generateStaticParams } =
  createBlocksPage({ collections: ["pages"], field: "content" });

export { generateMetadata, generateStaticParams };
export default ContentPage;
```

It lives at `@nextlyhq/blocks-react/next`, so importing the renderer itself still pulls in neither Next nor the CMS. `nextly` is an optional peer dependency, and a test asserts the package root reaches no part of it.

`render` and `buildMetadata` now also receive the reader the route resolved the entry through, as `context.reader`. A render that needs a second read — a referenced author, the media behind an image — no longer has to obtain an instance of its own, which on a per-tenant setup would be a different database.
