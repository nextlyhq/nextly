Let a block render nothing without being reported as broken, and test the core primitives through the boundary that wraps them.

A block that deliberately renders nothing, such as an image with no usable source, was replaced by a broken-block diagnostic when its node also carried an anchor id. Rendering nothing is a decision rather than a failure, and the two now have different answers. This is a contract for every block, including ones written outside the package, rather than a special case for the two that need it today.

The primitives were only ever tested by calling their render functions directly, which is not the path a page takes: the boundary appends the block type class, clones the node fields onto the root, and normalizes the output first. That gap is why this defect and two others reached main.
