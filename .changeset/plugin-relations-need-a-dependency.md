A plugin table's relation, `ref()` column or foreign key to another plugin's table (or to a collection, Single or field group another plugin declared) now needs that plugin in `dependsOn` or `optionalDependsOn`, and is refused at startup otherwise, as one added to another owner's table already was. A table's own single-column foreign key now carries a relation edge, so `with` can follow it as it follows a `ref()` column. A full plugin uninstall is refused while another owner's relation leads into one of its tables, a disabled plugin's included.
