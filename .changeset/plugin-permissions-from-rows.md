Show a plugin's permissions on its detail page again, read from the
authenticated permissions endpoint rather than the public admin-meta payload.

These are the rows the seeder actually created, which is a different set from
the declarations: a `publish` or `unpublish` declaration naming a collection
or single is dropped, because the seeder emits that slug itself and keeps the
row ownerless. The page now reports what exists rather than what was asked
for, and it reports nothing at all when the request fails instead of showing
an empty section.
