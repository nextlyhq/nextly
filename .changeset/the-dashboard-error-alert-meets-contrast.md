The dashboard's save-failure alert is legible at its edges.

Its border was drawn at 40% strength, which composites to 1.69:1 against the
page -- below the 3:1 a border carrying meaning has to meet. It is drawn at full
strength now, matching every other error surface in the admin. Nothing else about
the message changes.
