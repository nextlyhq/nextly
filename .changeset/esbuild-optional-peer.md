**Breaking for existing projects:** `esbuild` is now an optional peer dependency. Run `npm install --save-dev esbuild` in your project. Newly scaffolded projects already declare it.

It was a hard dependency of `nextly`, so every install downloaded roughly 9.6 MB for tooling that exists to compile `nextly.config.ts`. Nothing that serves a request needs it. Three things do: development, where the dev server re-reads the config; the `nextly` CLI; and production only when `db.runMigrationsOnBoot` is switched on, which is opt-in and off by default. A production deployment installing without dev dependencies no longer downloads it at all.

When it is missing, reading the config now names the package, the exact command, and what needs it, instead of failing with a module-not-found from three different call paths.

With this, `nextly` carries 20 runtime dependencies. `nodemailer`, `sharp` and `esbuild` have all moved to optional peers, which together removes roughly 28 MB per platform from an install that uses none of them.
