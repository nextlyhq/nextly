Move the core block library into the renderer package and register it at boot.

The block definitions now live in `@nextlyhq/blocks-react/blocks` rather than inside the page-builder plugin. A block needs the document model and React and nothing else, while the plugin peers the admin and the CMS runtime, so blocks kept there could only be used by a host that had both. That contradicted the renderer’s own promise that a document renders standalone.

They are also registered now. They were deliberately withheld from the registry while no renderer could draw them, because registering them would have made validation call the type known while the page still drew the unknown-block placeholder. The renderer has shipped, so the core blocks are registered at boot, before any contributed block, and attributed to the page builder.

`PageContext` gains `item` (the entry a repeater is currently on) and `queries` (a shared read allowance), which the dynamic block needs and the renderer did not previously carry.
