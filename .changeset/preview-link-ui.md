Surface the shareable preview link on the entry form.

Opening a preview and sharing a link are grouped into one control, because an author reaching for one is deciding between them: preview uses the editor’s own session and can carry unsaved changes, while a shareable link goes to someone with no session at all and shows only what was saved.

The control adapts to what is available rather than showing disabled buttons. With only a preview URL configured it is exactly the button that was there before; with only linking available it is a single button; with both it becomes one button with a menu, so a narrow sidebar already holding Preview, Cancel and Save does not gain a fourth.

While the form is submitting, both menu entries are disabled individually rather than only the button that opens them. The menu is uncontrolled and stays open across the state change that begins a save, so disabling the trigger alone would leave the actions inside an already-open menu able to run alongside the write.

When the browser refuses the copy, on an insecure origin or under a permissions policy, the link now stays on screen until it is dismissed and offers the copy again as an action. It previously appeared in a toast that dismissed itself after a few seconds, which is not long enough to select a few hundred characters of signed token by hand. The retry re-copies the link already minted rather than requesting a new one, because every mint issues another live bearer credential.
