Emit `user.created` and `user.deleted` webhook events. Both were already advertised as subscribable in the admin UI but had no emit sites, so an operator could subscribe to events that never fired. They now record into the transactional outbox atomically with the account change, through a new Drizzle-transaction recorder (`recordEventInTx`) that lets services running on `BaseService.withTransaction` — like the auth service — participate in the outbox without the adapter's positional transaction context. Each event is attributed to the authenticated caller and, like the content write paths, offers the fast-path drain and a bounded retention prune after commit — including on self-registration — so delivery and outbox pruning do not wait for the scheduled drain. The delete event reads the removed account's identity inside the delete transaction, so a concurrent update cannot make it report a stale address. The payload is PII-safe: identity only (id, email, name), never the password hash, a token, or role assignments.
