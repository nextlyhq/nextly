HTTP read endpoints now return entries/documents regardless of status by default. Previously, `GET /api/collections/<slug>/entries`, `GET /api/collections/<slug>/entries/<id>`, `GET /api/collections/<slug>/entries/count`, and `GET /api/singles/<slug>` defaulted to "published-only" and required `?status=all` to see drafts — confusing for the admin API Playground, which returned 404 for any status-enabled single or collection whose only document was still in draft. The new default is to return all records; pass `?status=published` (or `?status=draft`) to filter explicitly. The routes still require authentication, so this only affects callers that already have read permission.
