Add `@nextlyhq/eslint-plugin`: design-token lint rules that plugin authors can run in their own projects.

Nextly's admin is themeable because its surfaces read design tokens, and a surface that reaches past them keeps its light-mode appearance in dark mode. That contract was only enforced inside this repository, so the first-party plugins followed it and plugins built by anyone else had nothing checking them.

The new package ships three rules — `no-palette-classes`, `no-hardcoded-colors` and `no-static-inline-style` — with a `recommended` config bundled in. Install it and extend `nextly.configs.recommended` to get the same checks the admin holds itself to, in your editor and in your CI. A genuine exception is marked in place with a `design-lint-ok: <reason>` comment rather than by disabling a rule.

The repository's own design guard now derives which trees it scans instead of listing them, so a plugin package added later is covered automatically, and it reports what it read so a run that scanned nothing can no longer be mistaken for a clean one. The plugin template's settings page is rebuilt on design tokens, matching the guidance its own comment gives.
