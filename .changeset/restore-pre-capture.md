fix(nextly): make version snapshots complete and safe to restore

Several version-capture gaps that could lose or corrupt content on restore are fixed:

- Restoring an old version captured the content it applied but not the content it replaced, so content written while versioning was off (held in no version) was destroyed on restore. The current document is now snapshotted as a "Before restore" version inside the restore transaction, protected by the existing retention logic. This covers both collections and singles.
- A single's component snapshots stored relationship and upload fields expanded into whole related rows instead of reference ids, so a versioned single with a component relationship could not be restored (the write failed) and could leak the related row's fields past redaction. Component snapshots now store references only.
- For a localized, status-bearing single restored at a non-default locale, the pre-restore snapshot recorded the main row's status instead of that locale's, so undoing a restore could publish content that was never published. The snapshot now records the restored locale's own status.
- A localized single's snapshot recorded only the fields a partial edit touched, dropping the write locale's other, still-persisted translations. The snapshot now carries the full set of the write locale's translations.
