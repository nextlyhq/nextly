Emails can carry the site's brand without editing HTML. Brand settings (a logo and its width, an accent colour, the background and content colours, a font from an email-safe list, and footer text and links) are stored by core and read by `GET` and `PATCH /api/email-templates/brand`, which take the permissions to read and to update email templates. Core's default layout is now written in them, and every layout can read them as the `brand` variable (`brand.html` holds the logo, footer and link markup they make).

Nothing changes for an existing site until someone changes a setting: each setting starts from what the default layout showed, which renders every email byte for byte as before. On upgrade, a default layout still as core shipped it moves to the new version; one a site edited stays as it is, as do the site's own layouts. `GET /api/email-templates/brand` says which emails the settings reach and why the others are not reached. In a layout's data, `brand` is always the settings: a send's own `brand` value still reaches the template body, but no longer a layout.
