`reidSubtreeWithMap` is no longer exported. Use `reidForestWithMap([node])`.

It re-identified a single subtree, and it was a thinner version of the function
beside it: the forest form takes a policy saying what should happen to DOM ids,
and the single-root form never accepted one. Anything needing that behaviour had
to use the forest form anyway, and nothing in the product ever called this.

The forest form does the same work for one root as for many, so a caller passes
a list of one and gets the answer it already wanted, with the option this one
could not offer.
