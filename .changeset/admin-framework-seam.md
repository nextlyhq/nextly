Fix admin links ignoring modifier clicks, and route the admin's remaining framework-specific navigation through its own router.

Links in the admin panel now behave like normal links: Cmd/Ctrl-click and middle-click open them in a new tab, `target="_blank"` is honored, and links that point outside the admin (such as the Help entry in the account menu, which goes to the documentation site) open properly instead of being rewritten into a dead admin route. Previously every one of these was captured and turned into an in-app navigation.

Internally, the few remaining places that reached for the host framework's navigation directly — the command palette, the entry list's reading of the URL query string, and one entry page's links — now go through the admin's own navigation, link, and a new query-string hook. The entry list also no longer issues an unfiltered request before its URL filter is applied.
