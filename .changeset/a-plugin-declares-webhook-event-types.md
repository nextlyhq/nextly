A plugin can declare webhook event types in `contributes.webhookEvents` (experimental), each in its own namespace. Startup refuses a type outside the namespace, one of core's, one declared twice, or a malformed one. An endpoint may subscribe to a declared type, a subscription is judged against core's and every enabled plugin's types when it is written, and `GET /admin/api/webhooks/event-types` lists them for anyone who may read, create or update webhooks. A plugin cannot yet send an event of its own type.
