A field-group storage migration dry run no longer writes anything. It observes the migration lock instead of claiming it, so a preview works with a read-only database role, and reports what it could learn about the lock as `lock` on the dry-run outcome rather than refusing when another run is in flight. `lock` is `{ kind: "held", owner }`, `{ kind: "not-held" }` or `{ kind: "unknown", reason }` — an unreadable lock table is reported as unknown rather than as nothing holding the lock.

Because a preview takes no lock, another run can advance between its reads and leave it scoring the plan against a state the database was never in. A dry run now re-reads and retries when that happens, and the outcome carries `basis` to say which answer it ended up with: `{ kind: "reconciled" }` when the plan was scored against the live catalog, or `{ kind: "unreconciled", reason }` when a writer kept moving underneath it. An unreconciled preview still reports every rename the migration declares rather than an empty list, so it can never be mistaken for "nothing to do". Refusals that re-reading cannot clear are raised immediately, exactly as before.
