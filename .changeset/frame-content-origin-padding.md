Correct the frame content origin to include the iframe's padding, and measure that inset in one place.

An iframe's nested viewport begins at the content box, so padding displaces it exactly as a border does. Callers built the inset from `clientLeft`/`clientTop`, which report the border alone, so every frame-local point mapped toward the border by the scaled padding. `frameInsetOf` is now exported as the single reader, and both the README recipe and the `FrameGeometry` documentation name it instead of restating arithmetic three call sites had already got wrong.
