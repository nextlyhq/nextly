Fix Single document fields appearing empty after a component-field rename. Schema-apply and external-schema-update handlers invalidated `["collections"]`, `["entries"]`, `["singles"]`, and `["components"]` — but Single document data lives under a separate `["single-documents"]` namespace (used by `useSingleDocument`), which was never invalidated. After a rename, `useSingleSchema` refetched with the new field name while `useSingleDocument` kept serving cached data keyed by the old name, so the form rendered `data[newName]` as `undefined` and the field appeared blank until a hard refresh. Collections were unaffected because `useEntry` lives under `["entries"]`, which was already in the invalidation list. The `["single-documents"]` key is now invalidated alongside the others. Also propagate the Draft/Published `status` flag through `buildFullDesiredSchema` for both collections and singles, mirroring the earlier preview-pipeline fix so the full-schema build path doesn't drop the column either.
