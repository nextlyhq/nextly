Fix UI Schema Builder silently dropping the Draft/Published `status` column when editing a collection or single. Saving a field change on a `status: true` entity used to surface a "Rename status → \<new field\>" option (selected by default) because `previewDesiredSchema` did not propagate the Draft/Published flag into the desired snapshot — confirming the dialog DROPped the column and every subsequent entry POST with `status: "published"` failed with `table dc_<slug> has no column named status`. The flag now flows through the preview/apply pipeline for both collections and singles, so the column survives edits.
