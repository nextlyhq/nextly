A page's blocks now supply its metadata when the entry's SEO fields are blank.

`BlockDefinition` gains an optional `seo?(props)` returning a title, description and/or image. A block declares what it offers rather than a deriver guessing from prop names — a guessing deriver works for the core library and goes silent for every contributed block, which is backwards: a page built mostly from third-party blocks is exactly the one with nothing else to fall back on. Core heading, text and image blocks declare theirs.

`createBlocksPage` gains a `metadata` hook receiving what the document said about itself:

```ts
metadata: (entry, ctx, derived) => buildMetadata(entry, { fallback: derived });
```

Each field is filled from the FIRST block that offers it, independently, so a page opening with an image and heading later takes both. The offer is synchronous by design, so generating metadata never puts a network call between a crawler and the page title; a derived media id is resolved afterward through the same resolver the rendered image uses, so the picture in a link preview and the picture on the page cannot disagree.

The sitemap needed no change: `nextlySitemap` already takes a generic entries provider, and a blocks-backed collection is an ordinary collection.
