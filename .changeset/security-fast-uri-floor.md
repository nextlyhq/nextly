Security: fast-uri moves to 3.1.9.

- fast-uri before 3.1.9 had URI-parsing flaws: scheme spoofing through percent-encoding, host confusion during canonicalization, and two lower-severity ones (GHSA-w74x-v6f9-j3xg, GHSA-wjr9-j795-jxcr, GHSA-xhq7-xmqj-769h, GHSA-333x-w4r6-6crp). `@nextlyhq/telemetry` reaches it through `conf` and `ajv`, which validate only telemetry's own consent settings against a fixed schema, so no untrusted URI passes through it. The floor still rises, so no install can resolve an affected version.
