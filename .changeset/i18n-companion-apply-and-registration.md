Fix localized entities breaking schema applies and singles reads: SQLite/MySQL schema syncs no longer fail once a `_locales` table exists, singles created in another dev worker resolve without a restart, enabling Internationalization without a `localization` config is rejected with a clear error (and the builder switch explains it), and adding the `localization` block to nextly.config now takes effect without a manual restart in dev.

Collection and single tables **created on SQLite or MySQL from now on** also get the indexes Postgres and the Schema Builder already created for them, including the unique index on `slug`. Creating an entry with an explicit slug that another entry already uses now fails with a duplicate error on those dialects instead of being accepted silently. Tables created before this release keep the shape they were created with and are not backfilled, so an existing collection continues to allow duplicate slugs until its table is rebuilt.
