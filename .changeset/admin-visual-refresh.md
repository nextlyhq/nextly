A comprehensive visual refresh of the Nextly admin.

- **Consistent lists everywhere.** Every admin list — collections, entries, users, roles, media, API keys, singles, components, plugins, and form-builder submissions — now uses one unified data table with full-row navigation, and plugins can extend any list through new registries exported from the admin package.
- **Design-token theming.** Hardcoded colors were replaced with design tokens across light and dark mode: dark-mode surfaces and text, a three-tier border scale that fixes the pervasive faint borders, clearer sidebar active states, readable link/breadcrumb contrast, and more legible badges, checkboxes, and radios. The admin is on Tailwind CSS 4.3 with the shadcn setup aligned to Tailwind v4's `@theme inline` model.
- **Responsiveness.** The sidebar collapses to the mobile drawer across the full tablet range, wide tables keep readable columns and scroll horizontally, and the form builder's two-pane layout and tab strip adapt to narrow widths.
- **Auth and API-key pages.** API keys open a full edit page on the shared settings layout, the registration form places one field per row, and the auth pages have corrected borders and width.
- **Code-first schemas.** Collections, singles, and components defined in code now open in a read-only builder view instead of appearing broken.
- **Email subsystem.** A redesigned full-width template workbench with a fixed HTML/plain-text editor-and-preview toggle; emails send as `multipart/alternative` with a plain-text alternative; every send emits a consistent log record; providers gain an Active toggle and dark-mode-legible logos; providers and templates render in the unified table; templates and layouts are unified into one kind-tagged model; and a Send test action is available while editing a template.
- **Form builder.** The builder UI now matches the Nextly admin design system (monochrome theming), reports its version from `package.json`, and every package entry exposes a `default` export condition.
