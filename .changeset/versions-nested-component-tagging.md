Restoring a version now handles components embedded inside other components.

A version records which component each of its values came from, so that
restoring an old version after a field was pointed at a different component
reports the mismatch instead of writing the old values into the new component.
That record stopped at the top level: a component nested inside another one
kept no such record, so the same restore could quietly put the wrong values in
the wrong place.
