Webhook endpoints can now be registered, changed, disabled and removed.

The delivery engine, fan-out and signing were all built before anything could create an endpoint for them to act on — the only rows that ever reached the table were test fixtures. This adds the management layer they were waiting for: an endpoint carries a name, a target URL, the event types it subscribes to, and optional static headers, and it receives its own signing secret at creation.

A URL is resolved and checked before it is stored, not only before it is called. Delivery already refuses private, loopback and cloud-metadata addresses, but that happens long after whoever typed the URL has moved on, so a mistake shows up as a silent, repeating delivery failure. Checking at registration turns it into an error that can still be corrected.

Disabling an endpoint is kept separate from deleting it. Only one of those is reversible, and an endpoint id tends to end up in someone else's configuration.
