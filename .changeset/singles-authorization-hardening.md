A read that cannot assemble the evidence its access rule needs is now refused rather than allowed. Expansion is best-effort by design — a related table that cannot be read yields the bare id — which is right for a response and wrong for a document about to be judged: a rule written as `data.author?.suspended !== true` reads the missing row as permission. Every stored reference a rule may inspect is checked to have become a row before the rule is asked, and a read whose evidence is incomplete fails instead.

A Single deleted while it is being read no longer materializes defaults nobody authorized. The rule approved the stored row; if that row disappears before the read fetches it again, what would be created is a default document no rule has seen. It is judged before it is written, rather than persisted — with its localized defaults and first version — and refused afterwards.

The depth an access rule sees no longer drops below an ordinary read's. A caller asking for `depth: 0` narrows their response, and the authorization view now expands at least as far as an unqualified read would, and further when the caller asked for more.

Access callbacks can no longer write through a `Map` or `Set` in their argument. They already received plain objects and arrays as copies; these were passed by reference, so a callback could change the payload it was only asked to judge.
