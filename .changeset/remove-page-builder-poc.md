Remove the page builder's parallel document model, renderer and editor. Documents are the engine's `BlockDocument`, blocks render through `@nextlyhq/blocks-react`, and the plugin registers the `blocks` field rather than implementing an editor of its own. The `./render` entry is gone; `./admin` now exports only the blocks field's summary component.
