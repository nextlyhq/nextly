Custom read rules are now enforced on Singles. A Single you restricted with one was previously readable by anyone who could reach it, because the rule was never consulted.

The rule is judged against the document you actually receive: translations resolved for the requested language, component data attached, relationships expanded. A rule reading `data` therefore sees the finished document rather than a partial row, which is what makes a rule such as `data.secret !== true` mean what it says.

That decision is made before your hooks run and before a Single is materialized on first read, so a caller your stored data refuses reaches neither. The document is assembled twice for a restricted Single: once to decide, and once for the response after your `beforeRead` hooks have had their turn.

The rule is then asked again about the document being returned, because a hook may have changed it. One consequence is worth knowing: if a hook is what creates the denial — it sets the very value the rule refuses — that hook has necessarily already run by the time the rule can see its effect. The earlier decision covers every refusal your stored data supports; it cannot cover one that does not exist until user code produces it.

Rules that return a **query constraint** are refused on Singles rather than partly applied. A constraint narrows a result set; by the time the read is decided, a Single's document has been assembled from several tables and no longer corresponds to one row for the database to test the predicate against. Return a boolean from a Single's read rule; constraints continue to work on collections, where they are folded into the query.

A rule that returns no decision at all now denies, on collections as well as Singles. A rule is free to fall through without returning, and such a result was previously read as "allowed, with nothing to filter by" — admitting the caller and narrowing nothing.

Field-level read access is applied to a Single **after** the read is decided, not before. A field your rule inspects is no longer removed from the document the rule is shown, so a rule guarding a value the caller may not read decides on that value rather than on its absence.

Ownership is always decided against the stored row, and against the row actually being returned. An `owner-only` Single is not judged on the response object, which an `afterRead` hook or a field read rule is free to strip the owner identifier from — a transformation that could refuse a document to its real owner. It is judged on the row read before your hooks and again on the row read after them, so a hook write or a concurrent owner change cannot hand back a document the caller no longer owns.

A first read of a Single that has never been written is judged against the defaults it would create, so a rule that refuses those defaults no longer lets the read materialize the document (and its first version) before returning 403.

Your own claims on a `user` now reach the access rules, on every transport. A `custom` rule reading a tenant, a plan or an entitlement saw `undefined`, because the caller was rebuilt from a fixed list of canonical fields at four separate layers: the Direct API namespaces, the collection access service, the Single access gate, and the REST route-auth boundary. A rule written to refuse a caller therefore admitted it. Custom JWT claims are now carried from the verified session through to the rule, and the Direct API's `UserContext` accepts them explicitly, along with `roles` for rules that decide on more than one. A claim can never displace the authenticated identity: `id` and `roles` come from what the route authenticated, not from what the token says about itself.

A read rule whose exclusion list comes back empty no longer denies everyone. `{ id: { not_in: [] } }` excludes nothing, so it restricts nothing — but it translated to no SQL condition, and a constraint that narrows nothing is refused rather than allowed to widen a read. Members that cannot narrow anything are now removed before that judgement, so the rest of the rule is what decides, and a rule made up entirely of them permits the read. An empty `in` list is still refused: it should match nothing, and honouring it after translation dropped it would widen the read to every row.

Relationship depth no longer changes who is allowed to read. `?depth=0` shapes the response, and letting it shape the authorization view too gave a caller a way to blind a rule: the relationship stayed an id, so a rule reading into the related row saw nothing and read that as permission. Authorization uses the full read depth whatever the caller asked for.

Field-level `access.read` callbacks are handed a detached copy too, and so are field write callbacks. They run after the document-level decision, so a callback that reached into a shared group, repeater or component could change a document that had already been authorized — with nothing to judge it again. The copy is taken before nested fields are redacted, so a rule at the parent level still sees what the document held when the pass began rather than what an earlier-registered field's redaction left behind. Values that cannot be structurally cloned — a JSON prop defining `toJSON()`, for instance — are passed through rather than rejected, so isolating the snapshot never fails a valid write.

`findSingle` and `findSingles` forward your `fallbackLocale`. It was dropped, so a no-fallback read still fell back to the default language through the Direct API, and a rule keyed on it saw `undefined`.

An access rule that writes to its `data` argument no longer changes the response. Rules are handed a detached deep copy, so a rule remains a decision rather than a transformation — a shallow one still shared every component, repeater and expanded relation with the response — and password values are stripped after every callback that could reintroduce one.

A rule that reads an expanded relationship now sees the related row as stored, not as the response will show it. Related rows are redacted against the target collection's own field rules, and doing that before the decision handed the rule the hole rather than the value, so `data.author?.suspended !== true` read `undefined` and admitted a caller the stored data refuses. The response is still redacted; only the decision sees through it.

A draft Single stays hidden from an untrusted caller even when a stored rule would refuse them. The rule was decided before the draft/published filter, so the answer was 403 rather than the 404 that conceals a draft — which disclosed both that the row exists and what the rule made of the caller.
