Custom read rules are now enforced on Singles. A Single you restricted with one was previously readable by anyone who could reach it, because the rule was never consulted.

The rule is judged against the document you actually receive — after the Single is materialized on first read, after translations are overlaid, after component data is attached, and after your `beforeRead` hooks run. A rule reading `data` therefore sees the finished document rather than a partial row, which is what makes a rule such as `data.secret !== true` mean what it says.

Rules that return a **query constraint** are refused on Singles rather than partly applied. A constraint narrows a result set; by the time the read is decided, a Single's document has been assembled from several tables and no longer corresponds to one row for the database to test the predicate against. Return a boolean from a Single's read rule; constraints continue to work on collections, where they are folded into the query.

A rule that returns no decision at all now denies, on collections as well as Singles. A rule is free to fall through without returning, and such a result was previously read as "allowed, with nothing to filter by" — admitting the caller and narrowing nothing.
