Resolve a scoped preview link by the entry it names.

A preview grant that names an entry is now read by that id and confirmed to live at the requested path, instead of resolving the path by slug and comparing ids afterwards. A slug is not unique, so the old order could find a different document, reject it, and fall back to published, showing an editor live content at a link they were given for a draft.

When the named entry is gone or lives at another path, the request holds no draft authorization for that path and resolves published-only, so the widened lifecycle scope cannot surface a row the grant never named.
