Publishing a language's pending change no longer puts back a shared value that someone else published after the change began. Each pending change begun from this release on records the version it began from. One begun before it has none, so its publish is refused while any shared field it holds differs from the live value, its own edits included; taking the live values replaces those edits, which stay in its history. When a shared field's live value has moved on since, the publish is refused with a 409 that names the field (fields the caller can't read are counted, not named), and nothing changes. Taking the live values for the pending change brings it up to date, and the next publish goes through. The refusal's data is `{ reason, fields, hiddenCount? }`, exported as `SharedFieldsConflictPublicData` from `nextly/errors`; `reason` is `shared-fields-out-of-date` here. When every language of a Single is published together, the later edit's value is kept for a shared field two languages both changed. When version history can no longer show which edit was later, that publish is refused instead, with the reason `shared-edits-unordered`, and publishing one language at a time settles it.

Publishing a language's pending change no longer puts back a shared component or a shared many-to-many relation that someone else published after the change began. These are now checked against the change's base like the shared columns: an out-of-date one is named in the 409, and taking the live values brings it up to date. Components are compared by content, so a publish that only rewrote a component's rows doesn't refuse anyone. A component whose values are kept per language is judged by its shared parts: its instances and the sub-fields it marks shared. Publishing every language refuses with the reason `shared-edits-unmergeable` when more than one language is pending and any of them changed such a component's shared parts, since each language's copy would write over the others'; publishing one language at a time settles it. Taking the live values is also available over REST, at `POST …/versions/working-draft/take-live?locale=` for a collection entry and a Single, and in the admin: a publish refused over out-of-date shared fields offers "Take the live values" on the refusal itself, keeping the editor's own edits.
