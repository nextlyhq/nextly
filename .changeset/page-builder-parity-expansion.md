Expand the page builder toward Elementor/Gutenberg parity: a much larger block set, deep per-block options, entrance motion, global design tokens, and platform helpers — all built on the plugin's existing extension seams with no Nextly-core changes.

- **`supports` capability model.** A block declares which style capabilities it exposes (`supports: { typography, color, background, border, shadow, dimensions, position, opacity, filters, motion, visibility, interactions, customCss, customAttributes }`) and the inspector's Style/Advanced controls plus the compiled CSS are derived from that single declaration. `styleControls` remains as an escape hatch.
- **Expanded styling.** The typed `StyleValues` now covers full typography (family/weight/appearance/letter-case/decoration/line-height/letter- & word-spacing), structured borders, box-shadow (with presets), background image + linear gradient, sizing (min-height/object-fit/overflow/aspect-ratio), opacity, CSS filters, transforms, absolute/fixed/sticky position + z-index, Gutenberg-style width alignment (wide/full), and descendant link colors (default/hover). All values pass css-tree validation before emission.
- **Per-block custom CSS + attributes.** Authors can write per-block CSS using the Elementor-style `selector` keyword (sanitized and scoped at render), set a CSS ID and custom HTML attributes (allowlisted), and hide a block per breakpoint. New composite inspector controls: border, background, gradient, position, slider, box-shadow, unit-aware dimension, repeater, and icon picker; the typography selects now carry real option lists.
- **~40 new/upgraded blocks.** Structure (Columns, Spacer, Divider, Anchor, Row/Stack); Basic (List, Icon List, Badge, Icon, Button Group, Rich Text, Table, Social Icons, Progress Bar, Counter, Rating, Countdown) plus inline formatting (bold/italic/link/highlight/strikethrough/sub/superscript) on Paragraph/Heading/List; Media (Cover, Gallery, Image/Logo Carousel, Slides, Content Carousel, Hotspot, Lottie) plus Image (caption/link/aspect/rounded) and Video (self-hosted, autoplay/mute/loop/controls, privacy host, poster) upgrades; Content cards (Icon Box, Image Box, CTA Card, Flip Box, Pricing Table, Price List, Form, Testimonial + Carousel, Reviews, Logo Cloud); Interactive (Tabs, Accordion, Toggle, Off Canvas — all server-rendered with no client JS via CSS scroll-snap / native `<details>` / the checkbox-hack); Utility (HTML/Embed, Map, reusable `core/ref`).
- **Entrance motion.** A `motion` option compiles fade/slide/zoom entrance animations to CSS wrapped in `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`, with keyframes emitted once per page.
- **Platform helpers.** Global design tokens surfaced as inspector color swatches, cycle-guarded reusable blocks (`core/ref`), template composition (`composeTemplate`), revision snapshot/prune helpers, and editor copy/paste + copy-style/paste-style with a navigator flatten utility.
- **Packaging fix.** `sideEffects` now covers the source admin and block-registration entries so the plugin's components and blocks register from a plain side-effect import even under source-mode/monorepo bundling (previously tree-shaken, leaving the editor empty).

All additions are additive and optional, so existing pages need no migration.
