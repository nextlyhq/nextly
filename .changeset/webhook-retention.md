Recorded webhook events are now cleaned up automatically.

Every content change records an event, including in projects that have not set up any webhooks, so that table would otherwise grow for as long as the project is edited. Events are now removed once they are old enough and nothing is still waiting to deliver them, and delivery attempts are removed sooner than the events they belong to. Cleanup runs when webhooks are processed and, for projects that never process any, alongside ordinary content saves, so it does not depend on a scheduled job. It is bounded, so no single save waits on a large cleanup, and a cleanup that fails can never fail the save it followed.

How long to keep everything is configurable under `webhooks.retention`, in milliseconds, with `false` anywhere meaning keep forever. Events are kept 30 days by default and delivery attempts 7 days. Events also carry a retention class, so the ones a future audit log depends on can be kept for a year while the rest are cleaned up in days.
