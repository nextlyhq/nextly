Harden the block renderer against malformed stored documents and hostile block output.

The document envelope is now checked before it is read, so a corrupt column holding a non-object renders a placeholder instead of throwing in the page component where no block boundary exists. A stored attribute bag with several case variants of `id` now reserves the value that will actually render, matching the last-write-wins rule the render path uses. A node stored ahead of its block definition no longer reserves a DOM id it will never emit.

Block output is checked further: a `dangerouslySetInnerHTML.__html` value React cannot convert to a string is refused rather than left to throw during serialization, an object impersonating the `React.lazy` shape is refused, and a promise inside an element rejected for its own shape is now marked handled so a rejection cannot take the process down.
