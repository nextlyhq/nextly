Generated types compile in more of the apps they are written into, and Nextly's own setup paths follow the app's layout.

- A relationship or upload field pointing at a built-in collection is typed with a type the file has: `users` as the generated `User`, and `media` as `MediaFile`, imported from `nextly` (the type `nextly.media.findByID` returns). It was typed as `Users` or `Media`, which nothing declared, so an app with such a field stopped compiling once its types were generated. A collection you define with one of those slugs keeps its own interface, and when your config declares its own `MediaFile`, the built-in one is imported as `NextlyMediaFile`.
- `nextly init` in an app without `src/` writes its folders, its `nextly.config.ts` paths and `lib/nextly.ts` at the root, where generation writes too, instead of creating a `src/` tree beside the root `app/`.
- A project made from the blog template declares `@nextlyhq/plugin-sdk`, the form builder's peer. Yarn installs no missing peer, so under Plug'n'Play the form builder could not load it and the config failed to load.
- The blog template's featured-image alt text check reads the image through `nextly.media.findByID`, and refuses the save when the image cannot be read or no longer exists, rather than letting the post through unchecked.
