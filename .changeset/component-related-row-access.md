Field-level read rules now reach related rows inside components. A component's relationship fields copy whole rows out of the collection they point at, and neither the parent entity's field list nor the component's describes that collection's fields, so a field you protected there was returned inside the populated component to any caller that could read the parent. Reading a collection entry or a Single now judges those related rows by the rules of the collection they come from, for the caller making the request.

This completes the read side of the redaction added for direct relationships. Write-side callers that assemble a payload without a caller are unchanged, so a mutation response still returns what it did before.
