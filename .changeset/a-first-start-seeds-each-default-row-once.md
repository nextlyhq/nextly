Several processes starting Nextly against one fresh database at once, as `next build`'s workers and a fleet of instances do, now seed each default row once without reporting the ones another process wrote first. The process that lost the race used to log the duplicate as a warning or an error with a stack trace (an email template, a role preset, a plugin's role), report the whole permission step as failed and skip the plugin roles that wait for it, or fail its sync of the code-defined user fields. A row another process wrote is now taken as seeded and logged at debug; any other failure is still reported as before. The same holds for a Single's default document, which its first read creates: concurrent first reads, such as a fresh build's pages, used to fail every read but one with a `UNIQUE constraint failed` error logged at error level, and each now gets the one document that was stored. On PostgreSQL and SQLite, a permission another process created at the same moment was also reported as created under an id that was never stored, so a grant made for it could point at no permission: the permission is now read back and reported as found.
