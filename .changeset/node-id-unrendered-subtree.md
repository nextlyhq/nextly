Stop a block that never reaches the page from taking a node id off one that does.

Node ids are made unique before anything renders, because they are also React's keys. That pass walked the whole stored tree, including the children of a node already known to be replaced by a placeholder. A placeholder replaces its node entirely, so those children were never going to be drawn, but they could still claim an id first and delete the later visible sibling that shared it. The reader lost real content and got a diagnostic for something that was never on the page.

The descent now stops at a node that will not render its own markup. The node itself keeps its id, because its placeholder does render and still needs a key.

This is the rule already applied to condition-gated nodes, and the one applied to DOM ids, extended to the one position that had been missed. Reaching it needs a document holding two nodes with the same id, which validation rejects at write time, so it can only arrive from a row edited outside the product.
