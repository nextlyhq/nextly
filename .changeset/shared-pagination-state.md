Give a list's page state one implementation.

Thirteen places in the admin held the same two lines: set the page size, return to page one. The copy that drifted meant choosing a larger page size from a later page asked for rows past the end of the list, and the table rendered its empty message over a list that had rows.

`usePagination` owns page and size together, so the resets travel with the state rather than with each caller: a size change returns to the first page, and `resetPage` covers a search or filter change that alters which rows exist. Both settings move in one update, so a query keyed on them refetches once rather than once per setter. `useServerTable` derives from it rather than restating it.
