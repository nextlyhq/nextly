`no-hardcoded-colors` now catches CSS named colours.

The rule already rejected hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()` and `oklch()`, but a name like `deepskyblue` passed — which is how a fixed colour that ignores light and dark mode sat on the page-builder's drop indicator until it was found by reading a file flagged for something else.

A colour name is an ordinary word, so it is reported only where its position makes it a colour: the value of a colour-valued style property, or the right-hand side of a CSS declaration. Prose and data are untouched — `"the red team"`, `{ fruit: "plum" }` and a label reading `"Tomato"` are all fine. `black`, `white` and `transparent` stay exempt, as their hex spellings already were.

The rules also stop applying to test files, matching the repository's CSS guard. A fixture writing `color: red` is modelling arbitrary user data rather than styling a surface that ships.
