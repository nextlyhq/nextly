Collection status webhook events now fire. Publishing an entry delivers `entry.published` (and the generic `entry.status_changed`); unpublishing delivers `entry.unpublished` (and `entry.status_changed`); any other status change delivers `entry.status_changed`. A create-as-published delivers `entry.created` + `entry.published`. `publishAllLocales` delivers one event per locale that transitions, tagged with its locale. Every status event carries an explicit `statusChange: { from, to }`. Collections that opt out of recording (`webhooks: false`) emit none. Previously these event types were subscribable in the admin UI but never fired.
