A dev-server config reload now applies hook edits only when the reload advanced the runtime in every dimension. Previously a reload that applied part of a config — one collection's schema change refused while others landed, or a field-tree sync that failed for a scope — could still publish the new handlers, leaving them running against tables and serialized field metadata the save had not reached. A hook edit that shares a save with a refused schema change now takes effect on the next save instead; a hook edit on its own changes no table, so it still applies immediately.
