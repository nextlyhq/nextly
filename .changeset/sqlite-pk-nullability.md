`nextly migrate` no longer refuses on SQLite.

SQLite reports a text primary key as accepting empty values, because only integer primary keys are automatically required. Nextly's own schema treats every primary key as required, so the two descriptions disagreed on every table, and Nextly read that as someone about to make an existing column required. That change can fail on rows already stored, so it is treated as unsafe and the whole command stops.

The result was that upgrading a SQLite database was blocked by the very columns Nextly created itself, and `nextly migrate` is the documented way to bring a database up to date, so the only route forward was closed.
