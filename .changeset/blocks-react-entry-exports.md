Export defineBlock and the types a block author needs from the package entry.

A previous changeset announced that this package exports its own defineBlock. It did not: the symbol existed but the root entry never re-exported it, so every import of it from the package name failed to resolve, and the types needed to hand-roll a definition were unexported too.

The entry list is now pinned by a test, so a symbol added to a module can no longer silently fail to reach the people the release notes told about it.
