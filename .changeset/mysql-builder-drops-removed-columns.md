On MySQL, removing a field in the Schema Builder now drops its column.

The Builder's ALTER generator wrote `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS`, a form MySQL does not accept (MariaDB does). On MySQL the drop failed, the column stayed, and a Required field's column, NOT NULL, refused every later entry, both for collections and for Singles. The same statement went into the migration file, where `nextly migrate` failed on it. PostgreSQL keeps `IF EXISTS`; MySQL and SQLite get the plain `DROP COLUMN`.

Columns that an existing MySQL install kept from fields removed before this fix are not dropped by it: a save drops only the columns of the fields it removes. They stay, with their data, until removed on purpose.
