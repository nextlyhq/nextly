Add a version comparison (diff) engine and endpoint.

You can now compare any two saved versions of a collection entry or a single and get a typed, field-by-field diff: word-level text changes, added, removed, moved, and edited items in repeatable and component fields (matched by their stable id, so inserting one row no longer marks every row after it as changed), and added or removed relationship targets. The diff is computed on the server and is access-gated and field-redacted exactly like reading a version, so a field you cannot read never appears in a diff. It is reachable over the dispatcher and as a standalone `nextly/api/versions-diff` route for both collections and singles. The admin comparison UI follows in a later change.
