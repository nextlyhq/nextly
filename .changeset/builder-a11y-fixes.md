Two accessibility defects in the page-builder shell, found by an axe audit that
now runs in CI.

The canvas scrolls and nothing inside it is focusable, so at `tabindex="-1"` a
keyboard user could not scroll it at all. And the bottom bar carried an
`aria-label` on a role that prohibits one, so the name was never announced.
