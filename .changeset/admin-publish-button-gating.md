The admin hides publish controls a user is not permitted to use.

The Publish and Unpublish buttons on the entry editor, and the bulk Publish /
Unpublish actions in the entry list, now appear only when the current user holds
the matching permission. An author who may edit but not publish sees Save Draft
and no Publish button, mirroring what the server allows.
