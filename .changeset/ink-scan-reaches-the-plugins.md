The ink-contrast scan now reads the first-party plugins and the builder, not only the admin and the kit. Those three packages paint admin chrome with the same ink utilities and carried 230 of them, measured by nothing — so a token that is unreadable on a surface it lands on could ship there while the same mistake in the admin failed CI.

It found one: the conditional-logic notice drew its text with the base warning token, which measures 4.37:1 once its own 10% fill composites over the page container, short of the 4.5:1 text needs. It now uses the 600 shade, which holds 5.13:1 at its worst surface in either mode.
