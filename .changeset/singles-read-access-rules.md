Read rules on Singles now apply over the REST API. A Single's stored read rule was enforced on every update and inside the Direct API, but reading the document over HTTP skipped it entirely, so a Single you restricted to a role was still returned in full to any caller who could reach the endpoint. Reads now evaluate the caller against the rule you configured, and a Single's related rows are redacted by the field rules of the collection they come from.

A scoped API key is judged on its own read grant rather than on the permissions of the account that issued it, and super-admins keep the bypass they have everywhere else.

An `owner-only` read is judged against the document itself. That rule reports "allowed" for any authenticated caller and hands back the predicate a list query would have filtered by, which a Single has no list to apply, so the predicate is checked against the row instead.

**The standalone `nextly/api/singles-detail` GET route is deliberately public and does not authenticate.** A Single with no read rule stays publicly readable there, exactly as before. A Single you restrict is no longer served by that route at all, including to callers the rule would admit, because the route has no caller to evaluate. Read restricted Singles through the authenticated API instead.

If you configured a read rule on a Single expecting it to be enforced, this closes that gap. If something in your app read a restricted Single over HTTP and depended on getting it, that call will now be denied: give the caller a role the rule admits, or read it through the Direct API, which is trusted by default.
