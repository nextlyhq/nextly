Content releases and personal notices are no longer experimental. The releases REST endpoints and their parameters (tabs, search, the day filter, paging, the calendar read, readiness and its problem codes, adding several documents and scheduling a document in one step, Publish now, renaming and deleting, single-document releases, the unpublished-links report), the matching `nextly.releases.*` Direct API operations, and the notices endpoints keep their current names and shapes, and changes to them will be called out as breaking. The releases and notices docs now describe the admin screens too.

Browser tests cover creating a release, adding documents, fixing a problem, scheduling, Publish now and scheduling a document from its editor, each with automated accessibility checks.
