A site's generated admin component map now checks, at compile time, that each widget component it registers takes its own widget's props, with nothing annotated by the plugin or the site. A component registered under another widget's path fails the site's build.

To make that possible, `definePlugin` and `defineConfig` keep their widgets' types. Both are now generic, and nothing changes at run time:

- **`definePlugin`** infers the widgets of `contributes.dashboard`, and `rename()` keeps them. A plugin with no dashboard, or with untyped widgets, has today's type.
- **`PluginDefinition` and `PluginContributions`** take an optional type parameter, defaulting to today's type. Every existing use means what it did, and a typed plugin still goes wherever a `PluginDefinition` does.
- **`defineConfig`** keeps each plugin's type, and its return type records the widgets they declare. An untyped (plain JavaScript) plugin compiles as before, and does not turn the check off for the typed plugins beside it.
- **New types:** `DeclaredComponentMap` and `WidgetsOf`, exported from `nextly`, which the generated map uses.

**One deliberate change:** in a plugin whose widgets are typed, `contributes.dashboard.suggest` and the keys of `alternatives` are now checked against the plugin's own widget ids when it compiles. A misspelt id, or a `string[]` variable, that compiled before now fails to compile. Startup already refused a misspelt id. To migrate, write the ids as literals, or type the array as `(typeof widgets)[number]["id"][]`.

A plugin whose factory annotates its return type as `PluginDefinition` keeps today's unchecked type, until it returns `PluginDefinition<typeof widgets[number]>` instead.
