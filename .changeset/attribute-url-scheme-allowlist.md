Refuse an unknown URL scheme in a block's attributes instead of naming the dangerous ones.

The guard every block prop that reaches an `href` or a `src` passes through was a BLOCKLIST: `javascript:`, `vbscript:` and `data:` were named and refused, and everything else was allowed. So `blob:` was allowed — and a `blob:` document runs in the origin that created it, which is the page's own. So were `filesystem:`, `about:`, `view-source:`, and whatever a browser ships next. A blocklist has to predict every dangerous scheme and misses the one nobody had heard of when it was written, which is the same reason the style compiler and the remote-host policy are both allowlists.

Four schemes are accepted now: `http` and `https` for a destination, `mailto` and `tel` for the two that open an app rather than a page and are the ordinary content of a contact button. A value carrying no scheme is untouched, so `/about`, `a.png`, `#top` and `//cdn.example/a.png` all still work — which hosts may be REACHED is a separate question, asked of the host policy by the blocks that fetch rather than of a list of schemes.

These are the same four the rich-text sanitizer already allows, and that is deliberate rather than a coincidence: it answers this identical question for stored rich text, and two surfaces of one product disagreeing about which schemes are safe is how a value refused inside a link body becomes acceptable in a button beside it. The admin's link editor keeps accepting a wider set for what an author may TYPE, because that is an input affordance and not the boundary.

The scheme is still read from a form with control characters and whitespace removed, because a browser strips them before resolving, and the value returned is still the original so a legitimate URL is never silently rewritten.
