A plugin's panel section that finishes its work after the editor has moved to another document no longer acts on the new one. Its report of a change or a deletion now applies only to the document it was drawn for: no refresh, no redirect, and the author's unsaved edits on the new document are kept as a newer version arrives. The plugin SDK's stability notes now say advisory notices show on collection writes only, not yet on a Single's save.
