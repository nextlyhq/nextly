/**
 * A scoped API key must be judged on its OWN grants on every write surface, not
 * only create/update/publish. The session super-admin bypass (which lets a
 * super-admin skip a code-defined access rule) is skipped when the caller is a
 * scoped API key, so a super-admin who OWNS a narrowly-scoped key cannot use it
 * to bypass that rule.
 *
 * This pins two surfaces that previously did not forward the scope to
 * `checkCollectionAccess`:
 *   - `deleteEntry`
 *   - the version-label update gate (`canUpdateEntry`, used by
 *     `assertVersionDocumentUpdatable`)
 *
 * Each uses a collection whose code-defined rule refuses the operation. A
 * super-admin caller WITHOUT a scope bypasses the rule; the same super-admin
 * arriving as a scoped API key is judged on the key and refused — which only
 * holds if the scope is threaded through to the gate.
