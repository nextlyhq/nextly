/**
 * A scoped API key is authorized on ITS OWN stamped grants, not its owner's.
 *
 * The route middleware authenticates an API-key request and stamps the key's
 * scoped permission list on the dispatcher params. A service-side access re-check
 * (for example the publish/unpublish transition gate, which the route never
 * authorized because it only saw the write as `update`) must judge the key on
 * that stamped scope. Resolving the permission from the key OWNER's `userId`
 * instead — as the ordinary RBAC path does — would let an update-only key issued
 * by a publisher publish, and deny a publish-scoped key issued by a non-publisher.
 * This mirrors `auth/entity-read-access.ts` (`canReadEntity`) for the write side.
