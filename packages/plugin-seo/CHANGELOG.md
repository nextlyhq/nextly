### Patch Changes

- [#389](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/389) [`0c79043`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/0c7904333dc20351e7acd631def990de3179802a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Field group REST endpoints moved from `/api/components` to `/api/field-groups`, and the route re-exports from `nextly/api/components` and `nextly/api/components-detail` to `nextly/api/field-groups` and `nextly/api/field-groups-detail`. Apps that re-export these handlers must rename their route files and imports; the old paths are removed rather than aliased.

- [#388](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/388) [`711e0c5`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/711e0c542f9b771697a477bf43adc08e2970be52) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Generated types now use the Field Group vocabulary: `nextly generate:types` emits `<Slug>FieldGroup` interfaces and a `Config.fieldGroups` map, and the Direct API exposes `FieldGroupSlug` and `DataFromFieldGroupSlug` in place of their `Component` equivalents. Re-run `nextly generate:types` after upgrading so the generated file and these types agree.

- [#392](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/392) [`b51f4e8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/b51f4e8699dced423aa2cd4c38f12a3a6ddfed10) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The admin panel now calls reusable field structures Field Groups. They live at `/admin/builder/field-groups` (previously `/admin/builder/components`), and the navigation, dashboard tile, builder and list screens use the new wording. Bookmarks to the old admin URLs will not resolve.

- [#386](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/386) [`2eeef30`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/2eeef30a231e6931f90831567baecf8e617117d5) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Reusable field structures are now called Field Groups. `defineComponent()` becomes `defineFieldGroup()`, the `component()` field helper becomes `fieldGroup()`, the `components` config key becomes `fieldGroups`, and plugins contribute them via `contributes.fieldGroups`. The old names are removed rather than aliased, so configs must be updated on upgrade.

  Stored data is untouched: tables, columns and the JSON written for existing content keep their current names, so this release moves no data and needs no migration.

  Configs and plugins still using the old key now fail at startup with a message naming the new one, rather than starting up with those definitions silently unregistered.

- [#390](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/390) [`768bdc7`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/768bdc739932e2465f9bf0e59631fcebbd26149e) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The Direct API namespace `nextly.components.*` is now `nextly.fieldGroups.*`, and the dashboard, plugin admin metadata, and plugin introspection responses report field groups under a `fieldGroups` key. Reading the old namespace now reports the rename instead of failing as an undefined property.

- [#397](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/397) [`663306a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/663306a9518135b3b7f1351758c869a93ec3a63c) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Internal modules and services for reusable field structures now use field-group naming. This renames three container keys reachable through the exported `getService()`: `componentRegistryService`, `componentSchemaService` and `componentDataService` become `fieldGroupRegistryService`, `fieldGroupSchemaService` and `fieldGroupDataService`. The old keys are not aliased, so a call using one no longer resolves. The field group schema service also drops `generateSchemaCode()`, an unused generator that was reachable through that same accessor. Stored data, table names, config keys and HTTP routes are unchanged.

- [#385](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/385) [`d135685`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/d13568500541f9b9154ebaef7293ee17e8ab2236) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - fix(nextly): make version snapshots complete and safe to restore

  Several version-capture gaps that could lose or corrupt content on restore are fixed:
  - Restoring an old version captured the content it applied but not the content it replaced, so content written while versioning was off (held in no version) was destroyed on restore. The current document is now snapshotted as a "Before restore" version inside the restore transaction, protected by the existing retention logic. This covers both collections and singles.
  - A single's component snapshots stored relationship and upload fields expanded into whole related rows instead of reference ids, so a versioned single with a component relationship could not be restored (the write failed) and could leak the related row's fields past redaction. Component snapshots now store references only.
  - For a localized, status-bearing single restored at a non-default locale, the pre-restore snapshot recorded the main row's status instead of that locale's, so undoing a restore could publish content that was never published. The snapshot now records the restored locale's own status.
  - A localized single's snapshot recorded only the fields a partial edit touched, dropping the write locale's other, still-persisted translations. The snapshot now carries the full set of the write locale's translations.
  - Publishing every locale of a localized entry emitted only a single, document-wide `entry.published`, so a subscriber watching one language never heard its translation go live. Each companion locale that actually transitions to published now emits its own locale-tagged `entry.published`. The publish is also judged against the row read under its transaction lock, so it records nothing when the entry was deleted concurrently.

- [#391](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/391) [`962fd25`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/962fd25c323b8fd74a59a9d66c2be7a20910c42f) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Add a version comparison (diff) engine and endpoint.

  You can now compare any two saved versions of a collection entry or a single and get a typed, field-by-field diff: word-level text changes, added, removed, moved, and edited items in repeatable and component fields (matched by their stable id, so inserting one row no longer marks every row after it as changed), and added or removed relationship targets. The diff is computed on the server and is access-gated and field-redacted exactly like reading a version, so a field you cannot read never appears in a diff. It is reachable over the dispatcher and as a standalone `nextly/api/versions-diff` route for both collections and singles. The admin comparison UI follows in a later change.

### Patch Changes

- [#374](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/374) [`a44ab69`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/a44ab6988666317a9596d4019ad5bc1940995141) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Component tables are always derived from the component slug, resolved through a single canonical path. A custom `dbName` is no longer accepted on `defineComponent` or `components.create()`: it could name storage the component does not own, and whether two spellings refer to one table depends on database server configuration rather than anything the config can state. Components that relied on it should drop the option and let the table name derive from the slug.

- [#380](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/380) [`90108db`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/90108db693079600c7fda5349170711a64d6bb2c) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Relationships nested one level deeper now expand for collections you defined in code, not only for those created in the Schema Builder.

  `?depth=2` promises to populate a related document's own relationships, and it did so only for Builder-created collections. Resolving a target collection's fields read one of the two shapes those collections are stored in, so a code-first target resolved to nothing, the recursion guard failed, and the second hop was skipped silently at any depth — you got a bare id where a document was promised.

  Two consequences, both now closed. A `depth: 2` read returns what it says it returns. And an access rule reading across two hops — `data.author?.organization?.suspended !== true` — was enforced on a Builder collection while being quietly unenforced on a code-first one, so the same rule over the same data gave different answers depending on how the collection happened to be defined.

  Worth knowing if you use code-first collections with chained relationships: reads at depth 2 or more will now issue the queries that second hop requires, where previously they stopped early. Depth still bounds the walk, and a field's own `maxDepth` still overrides it.

- [#379](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/379) [`655532d`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/655532d43fbc685466cdb921e046269f5fdf59d1) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Plugin-contributed field types can now validate what they store. `PluginFieldType.validate(value, { data, req, field, path, mode })` returns `true`, a message, or a list of issues with their own paths. Previously a custom type could be invented but say nothing about what belonged in it.

  Values of a custom type are now also checked against the storage primitive the type declares. A `number`-backed type used to accept the string `"3"` on its way to a numeric column, because the built-in rules only ever matched built-in type names; they now run first, then the type's `validate`, then the field's own. A disabled plugin's field types keep their schema but no longer run their `validate`, matching how every other plugin behavior is skipped.

  `json` fields now reject a value JSON cannot represent — a cycle, a `BigInt`, a bare function — as a validation error naming the field, instead of letting it reach the driver and fail there as a server error. Values JSON merely reshapes, such as an `undefined` member, are still accepted. `contributes.fieldTypes` is documented for the first time.

- [#367](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/367) [`66053c3`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/66053c30325df31376b06a5dd919754a47648f7d) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Honour a Single's declared hooks and field defaults

  Two documented parts of the `defineSingle()` config silently did nothing:
  - **Hooks** — `hooks: { beforeRead, afterRead, beforeChange, afterChange }` were
    never registered, so none of them ran. They now register (via the scaffolded
    init helper, alongside collection hooks) and execute on the single read and
    update paths. `beforeRead` remains side-effect-only, matching collections.
  - **Field defaults** — a `defaultValue` on a Single's field never applied; the
    first read auto-created the row with `null` in every defaulted column, because
    a function `defaultValue` cannot survive serialization to `dynamic_singles`.
    Defaults are now resolved from the live code-first config, so a scalar or
    structured (group/repeater) default lands on the auto-created document.

- [#366](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/366) [`ee20d18`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/ee20d18c02c71f173354419497d89117e828f8b8) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Singles now get their storage table on MySQL, and on any app configured with only a `DATABASE_URL` rather than an explicit `DB_DIALECT`. The DDL for a Single's table was generated from an optional environment variable that defaults to PostgreSQL instead of from the database the statements were about to run against, and a declared `slug` field was emitted as a type MySQL cannot put a unique index on, so the table was never created and the first read reported it missing.

  The plugin test harness can also boot against a real database: `createTestNextly({ dialect: "postgresql" | "mysql" })` creates a dedicated database for that instance and drops it on `destroy()`, and `getConfiguredTestDialects()` reports which dialects the environment is configured for so a suite can cover those and skip the rest. The default is unchanged: in-memory SQLite.

- [#381](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/381) [`22b43f2`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/22b43f2b8a2c625df1336754df5931fba127a44a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Updating a Single no longer returns related fields the writer is not allowed to read.

  The response expands relationships, and those rows belong to another collection carrying its own field-level `access.read` rules. Read paths have evaluated them since the field-access work landed; this path forwarded no caller, so it returned every related field intact — including ones the same caller's `GET` would withhold. That made the write path a way around the rule: write anything, read the response back.

  A writer supplied a relationship id, not the related row's protected fields, so "they supplied the data" does not cover them. The rule that applies is the target collection's own, and it is now evaluated against the caller that made the write.

  This reaches every hop the response expands, not only the first: a related row's own relationships carry the rules of the collection at the far end, and those are evaluated too.

  Every caller the access gate applies to is judged, including one with no identity — an anonymous write permitted by a public update rule gets the same answer its read would give. Only a trusted write bypasses this, through `overrideAccess` rather than through an absent user.

  One consequence worth knowing if you write `afterUpdate` hooks: they receive the response as the caller will see it, so a related field that caller may not read is already gone. That matches how reads behave — related-row rules are applied while relationships expand, before `afterRead` hooks run — and it is why the two paths now agree. The Single's own fields are still redacted after your hooks, unchanged.

- [#369](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/369) [`f822937`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/f8229372896cd27f76ba4052e41771bd7a7f912c) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A read that cannot assemble the evidence its access rule needs is now refused rather than allowed. This covers relationships nested in a group or repeater, and counts references as well as checking them: a `hasMany` expansion drops the entries it could not fetch, so a list that came back shorter is evidence that went missing, not evidence that nothing is there. A relationship configured `maxDepth: 0` is left alone, since an unexpanded reference is what that asks for, and so is one declared with the legacy `relation` type, which is never populated at all. Localized references are checked too, by recording what the document referred to once translations were overlaid and before anything was expanded — which is the only point a localized reference is visible at all, and makes the count of what came back comparable for those fields as well. Upload references are held to the same bar as relationships. A relationship pointing at several collections is left alone: it is stored and served as a reference rather than populated, so demanding a document there would refuse every read of a Single that has one.

  Translation loading fails the read rather than reading through it. A companion query that errored was previously swallowed, leaving the main row's value in place — which a rule cannot tell apart from a translation that says so.

  A relationship that exists only inside a group or repeater is now expanded on read. The check for whether a Single had any relationships to expand looked at top-level fields only, so a schema that nests all of them was returned with bare ids. Reaching into containers is opt-in, and the write-response path does not opt in: it threads no caller, so the target collection's field rules cannot be evaluated for it and the rows it pulled in could not be redacted. Expansion is best-effort by design — a related table that cannot be read yields the bare id — which is right for a response and wrong for a document about to be judged: a rule written as `data.author?.suspended !== true` reads the missing row as permission. Every stored reference a rule may inspect is checked to have become a row before the rule is asked, and a read whose evidence is incomplete fails instead.

  A Single deleted while it is being read no longer materializes defaults nobody authorized. The rule approved the stored row; if that row disappears before the read fetches it again, what would be created is a default document no rule has seen. It is judged before it is written, rather than persisted — with its localized defaults and first version — and refused afterwards.

  The depth an access rule sees no longer drops below an ordinary read's. A caller asking for `depth: 0` narrows their response, and the authorization view now expands at least as far as an unqualified read would, and further when the caller asked for more.

  Access callbacks can no longer write through a `Map` or `Set` in their argument, including through an object used as a `Map` key. They already received plain objects and arrays as copies; these were passed by reference, so a callback could change the payload it was only asked to judge. Data that refers to itself is copied without recursing forever, and a value reachable by two paths stays one object in the copy.

  A `?depth=0` read still gets the references it asked for. The response deliberately leaves relationships unexpanded at that depth, so holding it to "every reference became a document" would refuse exactly what was requested; the authorization view judges those relationships at the full read depth regardless. Uploads are unaffected, since they populate at any depth.

  The decision made on the document you actually receive is held to the same completeness bar as the earlier one, so expansion that succeeds before your hooks run and fails after cannot leave a rule deciding on a reference where it expects a document. That check runs on the assembled document, before your `afterRead` hooks shape it — a hook is free to drop or replace a relationship, and nothing tells that apart from an expansion that failed.

  A read refused for incomplete evidence reports the canonical internal error rather than the underlying failure's own message, which for a database fault is schema detail. That covers relationship expansion, component population, translation loading and the per-locale overview alike.

  A group or repeater whose stored value cannot be read — malformed JSON, valid JSON of the wrong shape such as a list where the field declares a group, or a repeater row that is not a row — now fails the read rather than being treated as empty, which would have walked past every relationship inside it.

  Translation loading and the per-locale overview both fail the read when it is being judged, rather than leaving the fields off. An ordinary read is still served best-effort; a rule cannot tell "no translations" from "the query failed", so a read about to be judged gets the failure instead.

  Metadata attached to a `Map` or `Set` under a symbol key survives the copy handed to an access callback. Arrays keep their holes and their own properties when handed to an access callback, under the keys they actually have — a decoration like `"01"` no longer overwrites element `1`. Sparse arrays keep their holes, and a `Map` or `Set` carrying its own properties keeps them, so a rule reading either decides on the structure the payload actually has.

  A subclass of `Map` or `Set` reaches an access callback as itself rather than rebuilt as the base collection, which would have discarded its methods and private state.

- [#375](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/375) [`0febd62`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/0febd62ec556c1b2529b9fd8aaa26a505cbff066) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Collections and Singles created in the Schema Builder can now opt out of webhook recording from their Advanced tab, so content holding personal data never reaches the outbox or any subscribed endpoint. The setting is stored on the entity, takes effect on the next write, and survives restarts. Existing installs should run `nextly migrate` to add the new registry column; until then the switch has no effect and recording continues as before.

- [#378](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/378) [`0498e02`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/0498e02d756072306211bfc6f2a5d02f8cba249e) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - feat(nextly): capture versions on programmatic entry writes

  The tx-API and batch entry writes (createEntryInTransaction, updateEntryInTransaction, and the createEntries/updateEntries batch internals) now record a durable version snapshot and carry the full relational document (component subtrees and many-to-many relations) on their outbox event, matching the interactive create/update paths. Programmatic writers (importers, plugins, agents) previously left no version history and emitted parent-columns-only events.

- [#377](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/377) [`3785345`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/37853459a306f1323adb04d0c71ddc0a8f6338f9) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Programmatic entry writes now emit webhook events. Writes through the transaction API (`createEntryInTransaction`/`updateEntryInTransaction`), the batch helpers (`createEntries`/`updateEntries`), and `publishAllLocales` previously recorded no webhook events, so importers, agents, and plugins writing through them were invisible to webhook subscribers. These paths now record `entry.created`/`entry.updated` and the corresponding `published`/`unpublished`/`status_changed` lifecycle events inside the write transaction, so an event is delivered for every entry write and is never emitted for a write that rolls back.

### Patch Changes

- [#368](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/368) [`648c7f4`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/648c7f4b5463adb189b31527e7de276e094e00d2) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The admin's design tokens now actually drive its appearance. Setting
  `--radius`, `--font-sans` or a brand colour reaches the components that
  should follow it, so a themed admin looks themed instead of only partly so.
  Radii across inputs, buttons, cards, badges and panels are derived from
  `--radius` rather than fixed per component, and the font family tokens are read
  at their use sites rather than being frozen into the compiled stylesheet.

  Font weights work again. `font-bold`, `font-semibold`, `font-medium` and
  `font-normal` had been compiling to nothing, so headings, buttons and emphasis
  rendered at the body weight throughout the admin; they now render at their
  intended weight.

  Several colour bugs are fixed, mostly in dark mode: sidebar navigation labels no
  longer take a tint from a themed brand colour, the sidebar has a distinct resting
  and active ink step, the email template preview frame no longer paints a white
  box on a dark page, and floating panels, neutral washes and the draft swatch are
  tinted from tokens instead of hardcoded values.

  Borders are lighter. `--nx-border` is now a decorative separator, so tables,
  cards and dividers read as quiet rules rather than hard lines, while form
  controls keep a clearly visible edge: text fields, search fields, selects, the
  tag, code and rich-text editors, colour pickers and the date-picker trigger are
  all drawn with the control-boundary token.

  Radio buttons and avatars are round again, along with switches, spinners and
  status dots, which a non-zero `--radius` had been squaring off.

- [#361](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/361) [`7d5a62d`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/7d5a62dca59fe164dc24eef01df0a4e195430d22) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - `nextly migrate` can be run more than once against MySQL and PostgreSQL. The core schema comparison read several dialect spellings of the same value as differences — MySQL booleans, its `now()`/`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` defaults, and PostgreSQL serial sequence defaults — so a second run reported changes to the schema the first run had just written and refused to proceed. A `nextval()` default over any sequence other than the one its column owns is still reported as a change.

- [#306](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/306) [`6481791`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/64817910a41ecef468cf551f7b5a7df921bdbb0e) Thanks [@faisal-rx](https://github.com/faisal-rx)! - Duplicate entries now report "Resource already exists." instead of the stale-version conflict message, and CLI guidance only suggests commands and flags that exist.

  Creating an entry that violates a unique constraint returned 409 with "The resource has changed since you last loaded it. Please refresh and try again." — the message for an optimistic-concurrency conflict, which wrongly tells the user to refresh. The legacy service envelope now carries the canonical error code, so the REST dispatcher and the Direct API rebuild the precise DUPLICATE error.

  CLI guidance is corrected to real commands: the production auto-sync guard points at `nextly migrate:create` + `nextly migrate` (previously the unregistered `migrate:generate` / `migrate:run`), `nextly add` no longer tells you to run the removed `nextly dev`, and the `db:sync --force` help text states the flag is a deprecated no-op. `nextly upgrade` and `nextly migrate:resolve` now accept `--force-unlock`, so the migrate-lock busy error's advice to re-run with that flag works on every command that takes the lock.

Defaults reach nested group and repeater fields too.

  Two limits: a `defaultValue` written as a function is not applied on these paths, because the stored collection definition cannot carry a function, and bulk or caller-managed transactional creates are unchanged.

The boot-time schema sync goes through an entry point that was handed a database connection rather than a connection URL, and drizzle-kit needs the MySQL database name as a separate argument, so the apply failed and the first query against the collection reported a missing table. The name now comes from the connection itself, which also fixes the publicly exported `applyDesiredSchema` for MySQL callers.

Its value reached the driver unserialized before, so writing one could fail.

  The `webhook-notification` prebuilt hook (selectable in the Schema Builder's
  Hooks editor) delivered over a bare `fetch` with no SSRF protection, and its
  `secret` produced a base64 of the payload rather than a real HMAC. A signature
  that is not an HMAC gives a false sense of authenticity, so the hook is removed
  rather than left in place.

  Use Nextly's signed webhook system instead: add an endpoint under **Webhooks**
  in the admin. It delivers HMAC-signed, SSRF-guarded requests through the
  delivery engine.

  Migration: any collection that still has a stored `webhook-notification` hook
  degrades to a no-op after upgrade (the write path skips unknown hook ids and the
  admin hides the missing card), so content keeps saving. Re-create the
  notification as a Webhooks endpoint to restore delivery.

- [#304](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/304) [`051f660`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/051f660b1579c62cdeb9fbb6c729485b6b2733bb) Thanks [@faisal-rx](https://github.com/faisal-rx)! - The rich text editor now follows content-language switches and version restores.

  Lexical reads its initial state once at mount, so when a localized entry or single switched language the form fetched and reset the other language's values, every regular input followed, and the editor kept displaying the first-loaded language. Stored translations were correct in the database, but the editor showed the default language for every locale, and saving from that stale screen overwrote the open locale's translation with the displayed content.

  A sync plugin now loads external form-value changes into the editor: a language switch or version restore replaces the editor content, an untranslated language shows an empty document, and the editor's own keystrokes echoing back through the form are recognized and left alone so the caret never jumps while typing. The undo history is cleared on each external load so undo cannot resurrect the previous language's document into the current one.

- [#354](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/354) [`0c2c369`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/0c2c36989bc70ff057d038acd3654702bd4ce625) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Custom read rules are now enforced on Singles. A Single you restricted with one was previously readable by anyone who could reach it, because the rule was never consulted.

  The rule is judged against the document you actually receive: translations resolved for the requested language, component data attached, relationships expanded. A rule reading `data` therefore sees the finished document rather than a partial row, which is what makes a rule such as `data.secret !== true` mean what it says.

  That decision is made before your hooks run and before a Single is materialized on first read, so a caller your stored data refuses reaches neither. The document is assembled twice for a restricted Single: once to decide, and once for the response after your `beforeRead` hooks have had their turn.

  The rule is then asked again about the document being returned, because a hook may have changed it. One consequence is worth knowing: if a hook is what creates the denial — it sets the very value the rule refuses — that hook has necessarily already run by the time the rule can see its effect. The earlier decision covers every refusal your stored data supports; it cannot cover one that does not exist until user code produces it.

  Rules that return a **query constraint** are refused on Singles rather than partly applied. A constraint narrows a result set; by the time the read is decided, a Single's document has been assembled from several tables and no longer corresponds to one row for the database to test the predicate against. Return a boolean from a Single's read rule; constraints continue to work on collections, where they are folded into the query.

  A rule that returns no decision at all now denies, on collections as well as Singles. A rule is free to fall through without returning, and such a result was previously read as "allowed, with nothing to filter by" — admitting the caller and narrowing nothing.

  Field-level read access is applied to a Single **after** the read is decided, not before. A field your rule inspects is no longer removed from the document the rule is shown, so a rule guarding a value the caller may not read decides on that value rather than on its absence.

  Ownership is always decided against the stored row, and against the row actually being returned. An `owner-only` Single is not judged on the response object, which an `afterRead` hook or a field read rule is free to strip the owner identifier from — a transformation that could refuse a document to its real owner. It is judged on the row read before your hooks and again on the row read after them, so a hook write or a concurrent owner change cannot hand back a document the caller no longer owns.

  A first read of a Single that has never been written is judged against the defaults it would create, so a rule that refuses those defaults no longer lets the read materialize the document (and its first version) before returning 403.

  Your own claims on a `user` now reach the access rules, on every transport. A `custom` rule reading a tenant, a plan or an entitlement saw `undefined`, because the caller was rebuilt from a fixed list of canonical fields at four separate layers: the Direct API namespaces, the collection access service, the Single access gate, and the REST route-auth boundary. A rule written to refuse a caller therefore admitted it. Custom JWT claims are now carried from the verified session through to the rule, and the Direct API's `UserContext` accepts them explicitly, along with `roles` for rules that decide on more than one. A claim can never displace the authenticated identity: `id` and `roles` come from what the route authenticated, not from what the token says about itself.

  A read rule whose exclusion list comes back empty no longer denies everyone. `{ id: { not_in: [] } }` excludes nothing, so it restricts nothing — but it translated to no SQL condition, and a constraint that narrows nothing is refused rather than allowed to widen a read. Members that cannot narrow anything are now removed before that judgement, so the rest of the rule is what decides, and a rule made up entirely of them permits the read. An empty `in` list is still refused: it should match nothing, and honouring it after translation dropped it would widen the read to every row.

  Relationship depth no longer changes who is allowed to read. `?depth=0` shapes the response, and letting it shape the authorization view too gave a caller a way to blind a rule: the relationship stayed an id, so a rule reading into the related row saw nothing and read that as permission. Authorization uses the full read depth whatever the caller asked for.

  Field-level `access.read` callbacks are handed a detached copy too, and so are field write callbacks. They run after the document-level decision, so a callback that reached into a shared group, repeater or component could change a document that had already been authorized — with nothing to judge it again. The copy is taken before nested fields are redacted, so a rule at the parent level still sees what the document held when the pass began rather than what an earlier-registered field's redaction left behind. Values that cannot be structurally cloned — a JSON prop defining `toJSON()`, for instance — are passed through rather than rejected, so isolating the snapshot never fails a valid write.

  `findSingle` and `findSingles` forward your `fallbackLocale`. It was dropped, so a no-fallback read still fell back to the default language through the Direct API, and a rule keyed on it saw `undefined`.

  An access rule that writes to its `data` argument no longer changes the response. Rules are handed a detached deep copy, so a rule remains a decision rather than a transformation — a shallow one still shared every component, repeater and expanded relation with the response — and password values are stripped after every callback that could reintroduce one.

  A rule that reads an expanded relationship now sees the related row as stored, not as the response will show it. Related rows are redacted against the target collection's own field rules, and doing that before the decision handed the rule the hole rather than the value, so `data.author?.suspended !== true` read `undefined` and admitted a caller the stored data refuses. The response is still redacted; only the decision sees through it.

  A draft Single stays hidden from an untrusted caller even when a stored rule would refuse them. The rule was decided before the draft/published filter, so the answer was 403 rather than the 404 that conceals a draft — which disclosed both that the row exists and what the rule made of the caller.

- [#371](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/371) [`b8bf6d4`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/b8bf6d4ad9b70105f79a72ee818ea564b055dc63) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Media cards keep their metadata inside the tile, four more surfaces stay within their rounded corners, and the corner-radius guide now matches the components.

  In the media library's grid view, a card's file size could paint outside the card border while its dimensions were squeezed to nothing. At the six-column layout this left the dimensions reading as a stray "1..", and a long label such as "Invalid size" spilled past the tile edge. The size is now always readable inside the card, and the dimensions appear once the card is wide enough to render both values in full, with a tooltip on the row carrying both at any card width.

  Four surfaces painted a full-bleed child square across a rounded parent, which anyone running a nonzero `--radius` could see: the email-template segmented control, the component-row card header, the schema-builder field table header, and the code editor's validation error strip. `CardHeader` also gained the top-corner counterpart of the fix `CardFooter` already carried. All of these are unchanged at the shipped `--radius: 0`.

  The slash command menu in rich text fields declared a stacking order that never took effect, so it could be covered by a dialog. It now sits above one.

  The corner-radius tier tables in the theme and in the plugin authoring guide described a system the components do not implement, pointing plugin authors at the wrong step for alerts, table wrappers, checkboxes, icon buttons, switches and tabs. Both now agree with the code and with each other, they no longer offer `rounded-xl` and `rounded-2xl` as steps of the radius knob (the published Tailwind preset never exported them, and they do not go square at `--radius: 0`), and they state what `--radius: 0` actually resolves to for each step. A new test pins the contract so the documents and the components cannot drift apart unnoticed.

  `resolveContent` and `createContentRoute` (from `nextly/runtime`) now default to reading only `status: "published"` through the lifecycle-aware publish filter, so for a localized collection a draft translation under a published main row is no longer returned. They also enforce the collection's read-access rules by default: a rule-less (public) collection still renders, but a collection with a stored member-only or role-based read rule is hidden from an unauthenticated request (it resolves to `notFound()`). Pass a `user` to render member content, or `overrideAccess: true` for a fully trusted read.

  The Direct API `find` gains a `status?: "published" | "draft" | "all"` option that drives the same lifecycle-aware filter (constraining a localized collection's per-locale companion status), replacing the previous `statusField` where-clause on the content-route helpers. Status-less collections are handled automatically — the scope is a no-op there.

  `nextly webhooks:prune` runs a webhook-queue retention pass on demand (with
  `--dry-run`), so a self-hosted install can reclaim the fanned-out event ledger
  and terminal delivery log from a cron job. It reads the same `webhooks.retention`
  policy as the automatic passes and does nothing when retention is disabled. See
  the new "Webhook queue retention & VACUUM" guide.

### Patch Changes

- [#351](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/351) [`b44b1a3`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/b44b1a3a8c8264a2e0c3d497bdf0a19d3aab4e84) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - @nextlyhq/plugin-seo now generates a sitemap of your published content and serves it at a public HTTP route under Nextly's dynamic handler (in a scaffolded app, `/admin/api/plugins/@nextlyhq/plugin-seo/sitemap.xml`). It lists one URL per published entry across the collections you configure, reflects publishes and edits on the next request, and leaves out drafts and any page marked `noindex`. Configure the site origin with `baseUrl` and per-entry paths with `urlFor`, or disable the route with `sitemap: false`.

- [#356](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/356) [`a24c17e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/a24c17ef1d5dfaac61eae93fbe21da273e2565a4) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - REST reads now default to published-only. A list, get, or count request to a Draft/Published collection or single with no `?status=` returns only published entries; pass `?status=all` or `?status=draft` to include drafts (subject to your read access rules). Previously these reads defaulted to returning every status, which could expose drafts to any caller.

  An invalid `?status=` value (for example a typo like `?status=pubished`) is now rejected with a 400 instead of being silently treated as "all", so a malformed filter can never widen a read. Trusted server-side Direct API calls are unchanged (they still see every status). The admin panel already requests every status, so editors continue to see their drafts.

- [#353](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/353) [`48f82a8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/48f82a83a66eb9777364d5d9b0d8947c2bde767a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - nextly now exports `buildMetadata` from `nextly/runtime`: it maps a content entry's SEO field group (from `@nextlyhq/plugin-seo`) to a Next.js `Metadata` object, so a page's `generateMetadata` becomes a single call instead of a hand-written mapping. It sets the title, description, canonical, OpenGraph, Twitter card, robots (from `noindex`), and hreflang alternates, with per-call fallbacks for blank fields. The `next` dependency is type-only, so importing it never forces `next` at load.

- [#349](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/349) [`9cab18c`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/9cab18c499e9f42e1a1d9de3abb538f84a555436) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Add the first-party @nextlyhq/plugin-seo package. Register it in your config to add an SEO field group (title, description, OG image, canonical, noindex) to the collections you name. It is opt-in and framework-agnostic (no Next.js dependency), so it is safe in headless and admin-only projects.

  The plugin SDK now also re-exports the field-authoring factories (`text`, `textarea`, `checkbox`, `upload`, `group`) and the `FieldConfig` type, so plugin authors get the whole authoring surface from `@nextlyhq/plugin-sdk`.
