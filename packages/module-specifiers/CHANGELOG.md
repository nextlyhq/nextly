### Patch Changes

- [#1021](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1021) [`788363c`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/788363c98dab3fb2e97a316e0bc5eea0788207c8) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Every admin list withholds its primary identifying column from the column-visibility control, so a reader cannot hide the one cell that says which row they are looking at. Each list then asked that control about every column when computing which to hide. A column the control was never given is absent from its list of visible columns, so it answered "not visible" — and the name column disappeared from roles, users, api keys, collections, field groups, plugins, singles, email providers, email templates and image sizes. The control now reports a column outside its remit as visible.

- [#1127](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1127) [`23fe766`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/23fe76682f49ce3037ff70d556172b9fd28df98a) Thanks [@faisal-rx](https://github.com/faisal-rx)! - Signed-out screens now say why a request failed. Signing up, setting up the
  first admin account, signing in, accepting an invite, resetting a password,
  setting a first password and verifying an email all read the reason the
  server sent instead of a bare "Validation failed." A rejected name or
  password now names the rule it broke, and first-run setup reports each
  unmet password requirement rather than a single generic sentence.

- [#1077](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1077) [`6848510`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/68485109d294be88f89969a261048165acde2a09) Thanks [@faisal-rx](https://github.com/faisal-rx)! - The signed-out screens are drawn by two shared cards instead of fifteen
  hand-written copies. Sign in, sign up, first-run setup, forgot password, reset
  password, accept invite and verify email looked alike by repetition, so the
  logo, the mount fade and the branded product name could drift apart on any one
  of them. Nothing changes on screen.

- [#1057](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1057) [`57a2771`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/57a2771c82377227d4a6e6632eb5ce576000be51) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Separate autosave's recording machinery from the form it was written against, so a second editor can record recovery points on the same timing, status vocabulary and coalescing rules rather than reimplementing them. No change to how the entry and single editors behave.

- [#1043](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1043) [`820be87`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/820be87c5848ac40ce82e0dee570a20bf0f60aca) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Reading a past version of a document no longer offers a way to open the page builder on it. The blocks field now honours the read-only and disabled states the admin passes to every field, so a historical view shows what the field holds without an editor whose changes would be written into the snapshot.

- [#1087](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1087) [`fefbeef`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/fefbeefb6df32f3f723baa7ff29ece63c6c51efc) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Branded admin surfaces now pick a foreground that meets WCAG AA. The picker
  compared its dark candidate using the contrast ratio for pure black while
  returning slate-900, so a mid-tone brand colour could be given a foreground it
  had never measured: `#6366f1` shipped 4.00:1 against a 4.5 threshold, making
  primary buttons fail contrast for every user of that colour.

- [#1074](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1074) [`0353157`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/0353157e7337424e46d1ba04139b505e0356d329) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Two accessibility defects in the page-builder shell, found by an axe audit that
  now runs in CI.

  The canvas scrolls and nothing inside it is focusable, so at `tabindex="-1"` a
  keyboard user could not scroll it at all. And the bottom bar carried an
  `aria-label` on a role that prohibits one, so the name was never announced.

- [#1041](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1041) [`56bb1d1`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/56bb1d14cbde68ea8044b6e22ff66d5cda544036) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder can now make several changes as one action, so an edit that touches more than one block takes a single undo to reverse and either happens completely or not at all.

- [#1025](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1025) [`17c181a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/17c181a323606e109f6b35757b99c3702b6f5ed5) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder gains a floating toolbar on the selected block: select its container, move it up or down, duplicate it, or delete it. These actions existed only as keyboard shortcuts before, so they were undiscoverable without reading a shortcut list. Unavailable actions stay in place and explain why, and a press still announces to screen readers through the same live region the keyboard uses.

- [#1030](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1030) [`992a626`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/992a626a2458470a9bbfa128b65c9931dcbe2342) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Pressing Escape in the page builder no longer navigates away from the entry and discards unsaved block edits. The editor now claims the key: it clears the block selection, leaves a text field to handle its own dismissal, and stands aside only for an open dialog.

- [#1070](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1070) [`927183e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/927183ee98033531245cabd66d0d57bdd05a6497) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder now shows whether the page is a draft, published, or has a
  pending change — the status the editor's own chrome would have shown, which it
  hides while the canvas has the window.

  Fields can read it: `useDocumentStatus` reports how the document stands for the
  language being edited, beside `useDocumentIdentity`, which reports which
  document it is.

- [#1040](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1040) [`53e4495`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/53e4495c3d6d8e441cd43fc317c7a56257d48004) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder canvas now holds more than one block selected. Click replaces the selection, Cmd or Ctrl click adds and removes a block, and Shift click selects a run. The block the inspector is editing is drawn at full strength so it stays clear which one the panels describe.

- [#1068](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1068) [`b943c67`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/b943c67b3d253d4ccbcbe70a7e742c4cb7bd7ea0) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder now shows a getting-started card: add a block, write
  something, add a second one. Every step is read from the page itself rather
  than tracked, so it describes what is there rather than what someone once did.

  Dismissible, and a site can turn it off entirely with
  `pageBuilder({ checklist: false })`.

- [#1063](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1063) [`9bdc9b5`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/9bdc9b5be28e44305bd27a409c39dc03ef22256b) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Work laid out in the page builder now survives a lost tab. While the block
  editor is open its live document is recorded as a recovery point on the same
  debounce the entry and Single editors already use, and reopening the document
  offers it back behind the existing restore prompt.

  Autosave also stops re-asking once the server has declined it. An entity whose
  owner has not enabled recovery points previously collected a rejected request
  every couple of seconds for as long as an editor stayed open.

- [#1036](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1036) [`edb49ef`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/edb49ef7a56c06adf5059b9d021062db672d76b0) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder gains the rules a multi-block selection needs: click to replace, mod-click to add or remove, shift-click to select a run. Published as plain functions so a host or an agent reads a selection the same way the editor does.

- [#1042](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1042) [`a1a5705`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/a1a5705694ba0687edbb3aee711a00e50a3ddc92) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Delete and duplicate now act on every selected block at once in the page builder, as a single action that one undo reverses. A locked block in the selection stops the whole delete and says which one.

- [#1045](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1045) [`08175f9`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/08175f9fa1f697bd8d3265c8ce07bf06d2480a19) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder toolbar and inspector now answer for a whole selection. The toolbar sits over everything selected and offers the actions that apply to all of them; the inspector says how many blocks are selected and can lock or unlock them together, showing a mixed state when only some are locked.

- [#1029](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1029) [`744a791`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/744a79119534ac8db1ff292d6cf9beafd0fb959e) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder toolbar no longer shows a keyboard hint that named the wrong modifier on macOS, and its arrow-key navigation no longer jumps backwards after an action that moves the selection.

- [#1055](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1055) [`52abdfe`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/52abdfee28e3e2dafe12a356cf72aee4d5938de7) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Scroll the page editor's canvas while a block is dragged near its edge. On a page taller than the window, a block could not be moved anywhere outside the visible band at all, because the position it would land at never came on screen.

- [#1012](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1012) [`8a70233`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/8a70233318b52917c569c1e5a253d2becf4ad556) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Clicking a block on the page-builder canvas selects it again. A drag took control of the pointer
  as soon as the mouse went down, which made the browser report every click as landing on the canvas
  background rather than on a block — so clicking a block cleared the selection instead of setting
  it. The canvas now takes control only once a drag has actually started.

- [#1007](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1007) [`fd5355c`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/fd5355c06ba1c09be8924683847e8bf211531f69) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Blocks can now be dragged on the page-builder canvas. Dragging a block shows a line where it
  will land and drops it there, including into a container, and the line is chosen by the region
  the pointer is over rather than by the nearest rectangle — so a block goes where it is aimed
  even when its neighbours are very different heights. Pressing Escape abandons a drag without
  moving anything, a press that does not travel stays a click, and a locked block does not move.
  Everything drag does was already possible from the keyboard, which remains the way to place a
  block precisely between two very short ones.

- [#1120](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1120) [`9014091`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/90140917f98b0ae7841c2a4162f85af7b22846dc) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Pressing undo while typing a block's text on the canvas rewound the document instead of the words.
  The author lost a block move they had finished with, kept the sentence they wanted back, and got no
  undo where they asked for one.

  `mod+z`, `mod+shift+z` and `mod+y` now decline while the caret is in text, leaving the keystroke to
  the element — which is what an uncontrolled `contentEditable` needs, since inline editing hands the
  DOM over precisely so the browser's own history serves the caret.

- [#1085](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1085) [`59c702f`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/59c702fdba7526ec6d7fc1e6002404e413c56452) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A code field is now announced by its label. It renders an editor built from
  several elements with no single control to attach the label to, so the label
  resolved to nothing and a screen reader reached an unnamed region. It is exposed
  as a named group instead, matching how rich text, relationship and upload fields
  are already handled.

- [#1039](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1039) [`03a47b3`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/03a47b303bc0523918357c3256cc585aafdb6b58) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - An email provider whose parser returns a value JSON can only carry as text now has it stored in that form, instead of the save being refused.

  The stored configuration is defined as its serialisation, so a `Date` becoming an ISO string is a coercion and is accepted. A parser returning a value that would LOSE data is still refused, and the message now names the field that would be lost rather than describing the rule in the abstract: a key JSON drops, an array's named properties, or a `Map` or `Set` whose entries serialisation cannot see at all.

  A parser that returns a different value each time it reads the same input is still refused, because stored credentials would not survive a read. That comparison is now structural, so a parser that rebuilds its output field by field is no longer refused for changing the order of its own fields.

- [#1110](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1110) [`5089c60`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/5089c60843af94b0726036ce4dacfb3f95a4f998) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Add the storage and the read rule for scheduled content releases: two core tables, a repository, and the pure rule that decides what a release says a document looks like now. Nothing reads them yet. Also removes the reserved `versions.drafts.schedulePublish` option and the unused `scheduled` version status, which were parsed and never read.

- [#1054](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1054) [`85824d9`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/85824d957f685b31565fddb354e5134b2e4f22de) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Stop dropping plugin-contributed field types from every save. A field declared with `pluginField()` — the page builder's blocks field, and any type a plugin adds — was stripped from the request body by the form's validation schema, so edits to it were silently discarded in both the entry and single editors.

- [#1129](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1129) [`522d7d6`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/522d7d664850964948613477994f447ac4641a2c) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Two reads in the page builder's control derivation are corrected. A composite's
  nested field is read by OWN key, as the engine reads style maps everywhere else,
  so a field reached through a prototype no longer decides which control is drawn
  and an inherited accessor no longer runs during a read taken only to draw a
  panel. And an empty record stays on the composite arm: the validator accepts
  `{}` there, so requiring at least one named field sent a stored
  `borderRadius: {}` to the scalar variant and drew a single length control for a
  value the document holds in the four-corner form.

- [#1056](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1056) [`ff9ba6c`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/ff9ba6c89ed87f936302389589f98b57e90d8653) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Let a core table gain an indexed column when upgrading an existing database.

  The additive-tables-only recovery pass is diffed from an empty snapshot, so it
  emits every index in the desired schema while never emitting the column
  additions those indexes depend on. Creating an index over a column the live
  table has not gained yet failed, and because that is not an idempotency error
  it stopped the reconcile before the pass that adds the column could run.

- [#1060](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1060) [`4a05a64`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/4a05a64eb0743f7696f9c9f3205d211d46bb1ca8) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Let a contributed field know which document it is being edited inside. `useDocumentIdentity()` reports the collection entry or Single around a field, and the Single editor now supplies that context where only the entry editor did before — so a plugin field can address the document it belongs to instead of only the value it was bound to.

- [#1062](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1062) [`4d736db`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/4d736db3f39ede87dea9953efdf5d4c6578e7dba) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Hold a status-less edit on every collection write path.

  Editing a published document on a drafts-enabled collection stores the change
  and leaves the live row alone. That was true only of the interactive path: the
  same edit made through the transaction API or a bulk update went straight to
  the live row, so it reached the public site without anyone publishing it.

- [#1096](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1096) [`7d29da8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/7d29da8bb19c36b61da4fc940716df400fbed556) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Report why a collection or Single does not get pending changes, instead of the feature being silently absent. The schema response now carries `draftsDisabledReason` when the configuration asked for the draft split and a rule refused it, and a component that cannot be resolved is named once in a server warning. Adds `useDocumentLocale` to the plugin SDK, so a field inside a localized document can read which language its value belongs to.

- [#1032](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1032) [`90fe49b`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/90fe49b39011389d1d788fbce6703d46a7be3605) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Installing the page builder plugin no longer pulls in @dnd-kit/dom and @dnd-kit/react. Neither was imported by any code; they were left behind when the canvas drag shipped on its own implementation.

- [#1020](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1020) [`47f23f0`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/47f23f029c7662eab9862a44a0e60c34c16b440b) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A block can be duplicated in the page builder with Cmd/Ctrl+D. The copy lands immediately after the
  original, in the same container, and becomes the selected block so the next edit goes to the copy
  rather than to the block it came from. A named block's copy is suffixed, so two of them can be told
  apart in the layers panel. The whole block is copied, including everything inside a container, and
  one undo removes it.

- [#1093](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1093) [`8a3c96a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/8a3c96ab2bbaee266ebdf641dc02e2c6a1413fe9) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The editor canvas drew every block flush and unstyled while the published page drew the author's
  real spacing. An author setting a margin, a height or any other per-node style saw nothing change
  until they published.

  Node styles are a SEPARATE tier from the site sheet, and `PageRenderer` compiles them only when it
  is handed a style context. The public routes pass one; the editor never did. The failure is silent
  by construction rather than loud: `resolvePageStyles` withholds the sheet and keeps the class names,
  so every block carried its `nx-pb-<hash>` class and nothing defined it — the markup looked correct
  and the page looked unstyled.

  Measured both ways on one document, with the style context the only variable: without it, zero
  scoped rules, zero gaps between siblings and a spacer collapsed to zero pixels; with it, six rules,
  24px gaps and the spacer at its authored 48px. That collapse is also why dragging felt broken —
  the 2px drop indicator had no gap to draw into and landed on top of flush text.

  The breakpoints come from `siteBreakpoints()` rather than a set spelled at the call site, because
  `site-style.ts` exists so the field validator and the canvas cannot disagree about what this site's
  breakpoints are. The canvas is now its third consumer.

- [#1027](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1027) [`165fe0f`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/165fe0f8507dc1ca1da247ef5ce0fc6a0fe1bf0a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The content language an editor is open in now lives in the URL.

  `?locale=de` makes the language linkable, survives a reload, and comes back with
  the browser's back button. An unconfigured value falls back to the default
  rather than being sent to the API.

  It also stops a language switch from silently discarding unsaved work. Switching
  refetches the document, so the edits go — and as component state that happened
  with nothing able to ask first. As a URL it is a navigation, which the
  unsaved-changes guard already understands, so it asks. The guard now compares
  the query as well as the path, because here the query is part of where you are
  rather than decoration on it.

  A language mark in the entry list opens that row in that language, which is the
  same act as being sent a link to it.

- [#1028](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1028) [`73ff427`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/73ff427499412b947faf02c1e9515d95411ca198) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - **Breaking for SMTP users:** `nodemailer` is now an optional peer dependency. If you send email over SMTP, run `npm install nodemailer`.

  It was a hard dependency of `nextly`, so every install carried roughly 676 KB for a transport most installs never use, and it is the mail dependency with the most security churn. Installs that send through Resend or SendLayer, or that send no email at all, no longer download it. The SMTP provider, its settings form and its connection test are unchanged, and a stored SMTP configuration keeps working once the package is present.

  Three things make the absence explain itself rather than surfacing as a failed password reset. A send names the package and the command instead of reporting a module-not-found. The server logs one warning at boot when a stored provider cannot run. The provider settings form shows which package is missing, the exact command, and a link to its documentation, and still lets the configuration be saved.

  Email now also sends to the server log when no provider is configured at all, instead of failing. A fresh install threw a 422 on its first send, which is the password-reset flow, so a new install could not complete the first thing a user does after signing up. Outside production the rendered body is written too, so a developer can follow a reset link; in production only the recipient and subject are recorded, because reset and verification bodies carry live tokens. Mailpit remains the recommended local inbox and is unaffected.

  Email provider descriptors now report whether the install can actually use each provider, so a plugin that needs a package the host has not installed can say so in the admin rather than being offered and failing when a message is sent.

- [#1102](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1102) [`3dd8424`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/3dd8424520acd87e644cd1a810f4ac1972dd8e93) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A field that covers the whole entry form left its author unable to reach the rest of the entry.
  The page builder opens full-screen over the form, so setting an SEO description or a publish date
  meant closing the editor — and closing it discards its undo history.

  The builder's left rail now offers a Settings panel holding the entry's other fields, rendered by
  the form's own renderer through `useEntryFieldsPanel`. What the panel draws and what the form
  submits are one thing; a second form instance would fork the state and lose whichever copy did not
  save.

  The asking field is excluded, and so is the field its `admin.condition` depends on: offering a page
  builder inside its own settings panel would nest an editor in its own chrome, and offering the
  control that un-renders it would be an unlabelled second exit.

- [#1044](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1044) [`4caf451`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/4caf4511abd556564a92fc91a92493a23aebe9e1) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - **Breaking for existing projects:** `esbuild` is now an optional peer dependency. Run `npm install --save-dev esbuild` in your project. Newly scaffolded projects already declare it.

  It was a hard dependency of `nextly`, so every install downloaded roughly 9.6 MB for tooling that exists to compile `nextly.config.ts`. Nothing that serves a request needs it. Three things do: development, where the dev server re-reads the config; the `nextly` CLI; and production only when `db.runMigrationsOnBoot` is switched on, which is opt-in and off by default. A production deployment installing without dev dependencies no longer downloads it at all.

  When it is missing, reading the config now names the package, the exact command, and what needs it, instead of failing with a module-not-found from three different call paths.

  With this, `nextly` carries 20 runtime dependencies. `nodemailer`, `sharp` and `esbuild` have all moved to optional peers, which together removes roughly 28 MB per platform from an install that uses none of them.

The shared HTTP client treated a `null` JSON document as an absent body, so an endpoint answering `200 application/json` with `null` — which is what asking for an autosave recovery point does when the author has none — came back with nothing, and React Query rejected it with "Query data cannot be undefined" on every entry and single editor load. The client now returns the `null` the server sent, and tells it apart from a body that could not be parsed, which had been indistinguishable because both were caught to the same value.

  block edits now warns.

  A field that keeps its own editing state can tell the form so with
  `useReportUnsavedWork`. It reports one boolean about itself; it cannot save or
  publish.

Such a column is reported by introspection as `float8`, a spelling the rename detector did not recognise, so it judged the column incompatible with itself and offered only to drop it and recreate it empty. Decimal fields were never affected: they introspect as `numeric`, which the detector already recognised.

- [#1050](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1050) [`ce3ba3a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/ce3ba3a1f3a11a95ee14cbdbcbd3309c78f6de1a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The ink-contrast scan now reads the first-party plugins and the builder, not only the admin and the kit. Those three packages paint admin chrome with the same ink utilities and carried 230 of them, measured by nothing — so a token that is unreadable on a surface it lands on could ship there while the same mistake in the admin failed CI.

  It found one: the conditional-logic notice drew its text with the base warning token, which measures 4.37:1 once its own 10% fill composites over the page container, short of the 4.5:1 text needs. It now uses the 600 shade, which holds 5.13:1 at its worst surface in either mode.

- [#1067](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1067) [`e7c5261`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/e7c52610389b68c7f9e3d06f5e52b753e113bfa3) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Blocks can now say which of their values an editor may let an author type
  directly on the canvas, and which element holds each one. `core/heading`,
  `core/text` and `core/quote` declare theirs.

  Nothing changes on a published page: the marking is emitted only when a
  renderer is asked for editor addresses, so published markup is unchanged.

- [#1009](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1009) [`ead5fb7`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/ead5fb77a8d38dbe744d919bd56975cc4df2fcf5) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The "not translated" language dot drew its outline with `border-muted-foreground/60`, which composites to 2.87:1 against the page surface and misses the 3:1 a non-text UI boundary needs. The outline is the only thing that renders that dot, so nothing else carried the state. It now uses the token at full strength, reaching 7.55:1 while staying visually quieter than the draft dot beside it.

- [#1013](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1013) [`3727712`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/372771251b8a1d0439f9841b8e8d959d18632697) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder has a layers panel and an ancestor breadcrumb. The panel shows the page as a
  tree, so a block the canvas cannot show — an empty container, or one hidden at the current screen
  size — can still be found and selected, and a search narrows the tree to what matches while keeping
  the containers around it. Selecting a block anywhere reveals it in the tree and shows the trail of
  containers holding it, and each step of that trail selects the container it names. Blocks that are
  locked, hidden at some screen sizes, or shown conditionally say so on their row.

- [#1024](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1024) [`30d0860`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/30d08608f8aadeea36733762a312d03a8ccfb2f2) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Leaving an entry editor with unsaved changes now asks first.

  The admin ships an unsaved-changes guard — dialog, history interception,
  back/forward handling, `beforeunload` — and nothing has ever mounted it. It has
  been present since the first commit, exported through a barrel no consumer
  imports, and touched since only by two theme passes that restyled a dialog which
  never appeared. So navigating away from a half-written entry discarded it in
  silence.

  It is mounted now for the entry editor, and an action that has already asked the
  question — Discard changes — says so rather than being asked it twice.

  Not yet mounted for singles: an untouched single reports itself dirty on load,
  so the guard would question a document nobody had edited. That is recorded as
  its own defect rather than worked around here.

- [#1023](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1023) [`b8f5ead`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/b8f5ead0af1a2ea1a445e3b1ed6f13e07bc02b33) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The entry list shows which languages a row is missing.

  Two surfaces were answering "how far along are this document's translations"
  separately and disagreeing: for an entry with only its default language written,
  the editor's language panel read "1 of 3 translated" while the list's badge read
  "0/2". There is now one derivation, and it excludes the default language on both
  sides — that is the source a translation is made FROM, not one of them.

  The list's count is replaced by one mark per translatable language. A count says
  how much is left and never which, so choosing what to translate next meant
  opening rows to find out. Each mark carries its language and state in its
  accessible name, and the row carries a spoken summary naming exactly what is
  missing.

  That column also never actually appeared. It had been added to a second,
  unreferenced column builder that no table has called since the list moved to its
  current one, so no user has seen it. The live builder now renders it and the
  dead one is gone.

- [#1016](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1016) [`3782024`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/37820249b7014d3cae792061d5d24580b1fb205f) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A locked block in the page builder now resists being moved or deleted, and says why. Until now the
  flag was honoured only when dragging, so a block the layers panel showed as locked could still be
  moved with the keyboard or deleted outright. Deleting a container that holds a locked block is
  refused too, since removing the container would destroy the block inside it, and the refusal names
  which block is locked. Moving a container is still allowed, because its locked children keep their
  place inside it.

- [#1034](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1034) [`e12fef3`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/e12fef351831d6f0233e5c7ae8d2c11285e0bda3) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder now has a working command palette. Pressing Cmd+K (Ctrl+K) in the editor lists what you can do to the selected block, plus undo, redo and closing the editor, searchable by name. The palette existed but was never mounted, so the shortcut opened the admin palette instead.

- [#1051](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1051) [`c1f8d00`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/c1f8d00f363b4017264fb5a71c8b352a0d089156) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Move several selected blocks at once. The page editor's toolbar and its alt+arrow shortcuts now reorder a whole selection that shares a container, as one step per block and one undo for the group, where they previously refused any selection larger than one. A selection spread across two containers still refuses, and now says why.

- [#1114](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1114) [`46720cf`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/46720cff7457fc30f045ff2d4280760db10a3688) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - On MySQL, a schema baseline read from a live database could not be applied
  anywhere. MySQL reports a column's expression default — which is what a
  required JSON, repeater, group or chips field gets — without the parentheses it
  requires around one, so the recorded schema described a table no MySQL server
  would create, including the one it was read from. The parentheses are now
  restored when the baseline is recorded. `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` is left as it is,
  because MySQL quietly rewrites the parenthesised form into a different default,
  so a table rebuilt from the recorded schema would not match the one it was read
  from.

  This fixes the defaults Nextly itself creates. One case is still broken and is
  tracked separately: a default someone wrote by hand that contains a quoted
  piece of text, such as `DEFAULT (lower('X'))`, is reported by MySQL in a form
  that the parentheses alone do not make valid.

- [#1018](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1018) [`44fad04`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/44fad046d2a673e4e23c682652dec52863d36fb1) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Blocks can be named and locked from the page builder inspector. A name replaces the block type
  wherever the editor refers to that block — the layers panel, the ancestor breadcrumb and the
  spoken announcements — so a page with six headings no longer presents six identical rows. The lock
  checkbox sets the flag the editor already honours, so locking a block from here immediately stops
  it being moved or deleted. Clearing a name or releasing a lock removes the field rather than
  storing an empty value.

- [#1072](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1072) [`af6637b`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/af6637b48395cfbe5a56d3724f4115d608a58a4b) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Reading a past version no longer records it as the author's unsaved work.
  Choosing a version replaces the form's values, which looked like typing, so the
  old version was stored as a recovery point and offered back on the next visit
  as "unsaved changes".

- [#1031](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1031) [`2ba4029`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/2ba4029faa33272596b4c75a79c3b7293e72fe43) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The entry editor and the single editor agree on what a form starts with.

  They each carried their own copy of the function that builds a form's default
  values, and the copies had drifted in six ways users could see: a `chips`
  field's declared default applied in one editor and was discarded in the other; a
  `code` field opened empty in one and null in the other; a single-value `select`
  seeded an empty string in one and null in the other.

  There is one implementation now. Every divergence was resolved on its merits
  rather than by keeping a favourite, and the entry editor's behaviour won all six,
  so singles gain the correct handling and entries are unchanged.

- [#1113](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1113) [`29b5cab`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/29b5cab442aa852a974ead8e7333c68ff133a111) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The field-group migration lock now reads its clock and derives its timings from one shared module, so a second lock cannot disagree with it about what time it is. No behaviour change: the same expressions and the same 120s/15s/90s values, reached by one definition instead of a private copy.

- [#1126](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1126) [`2fe2409`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/2fe240971acbb6b0250af53a655369ed5a61bf28) Thanks [@faisal-rx](https://github.com/faisal-rx)! - The translator that turns a `WhereClause` into a Drizzle condition existed
  twice: the copy the adapter calls on every filtered read, update and delete,
  and a second, identical copy in `nextly` that nothing imported. The drizzle v1
  migration had already had to apply the same fix to both. The unused copy is
  gone, and the shipped one now carries the test suite — rewritten to assert the
  SQL and parameters each operator produces, so a filter that quietly means the
  opposite of what it says cannot pass.

  Writing those tests turned up two ways a filter could silently widen, and both
  are fixed. Neither affects a where clause that already produced a condition.
  - A clause whose branches ALL resolve to nothing — `{ and: [{}] }`,
    `{ not: {} }`, `{ or: [{}] }` — used to come back as "no condition". Because
    `update` and `delete` take the where clause as a required argument and omit
    the WHERE when none is returned, asking to delete a subset that way deleted
    the whole table. It now throws. An empty `{}`, which is how callers say "no
    filter", is unchanged.
  - `CONTAINS` now matches its value literally: `%` and `_` inside it are escaped
    rather than acting as wildcards, so `CONTAINS "50%"` finds the text "50%"
    instead of every row containing "50". Verified against PostgreSQL 17,
    MySQL 8.4 and SQLite.

  `WHERE_OPERATORS` is a new export from `@nextlyhq/adapter-drizzle/types`: the
  list of every operator a where clause accepts, as a value. The `WhereOperator`
  type is now derived from it, so code validating caller input against the list
  and the type narrowing that input cannot fall out of step.

- [#1061](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1061) [`1d26760`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/1d26760212d85ae95d1aa44697a9846cdcf18570) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Give the working-draft write one implementation.

  The store-and-accumulate step lived inline in a single update path, which is why
  the transaction-owning and batch write surfaces could not reach it. It is now a
  method those paths can call, with no change to what the existing caller does.

- [#1123](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1123) [`8356918`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/83569186484391113629e38cb003dc883f38e5f2) Thanks [@faisal-rx](https://github.com/faisal-rx)! - Creating, updating and deleting an entry inside a transaction ran through two
  implementations: one for a caller that owns the transaction, and a separate
  streamlined copy the batch services call per item. The copies had already
  drifted — a truncated comment on one side, a differently worded error message,
  and a first-publication marker whose rule had to be restated for the batch path
  after it was found missing there. Each verb now has ONE implementation that both
  entry points delegate to, so the two cannot disagree again; the things that
  genuinely differ between them (whether the collection-level access check runs
  here or was hoisted to a batch caller, whether user hooks run, and which shape
  of the row-ownership gate applies) are named options on that one path rather
  than two bodies kept in step by hand.

  No behaviour changes. Every public method keeps its signature, and the batch
  services are untouched.

- [#1075](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1075) [`6bfba73`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/6bfba73f953c8ad3abb6032f2a014a2e75e083f9) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Show which languages hold unpublished changes, and confirm before publishing all.

  The language panel now marks a language that has changes waiting, so an editor
  can see it without opening each language in turn. Publishing every language asks
  first and says how many carry unpublished work, because that action puts all of
  it live at once.

  Two fixes underneath: an edit that named no language was written straight to the
  live site instead of being held, and a translated document's pending change was
  never shown back to the editor who saved it.

- [#1066](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1066) [`3a48dce`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/3a48dcec2afc68d8a7ef8b81178ac3ff044e8c76) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Hold pending changes per language on a translated document.

  Editing a published translation now holds the change for that language and
  leaves the other translations alone, and publishing a language publishes that
  language's pending change. Previously a multilingual collection had no pending
  changes at all: every edit to a published translation went straight to the live
  site.

- [#1079](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1079) [`e86d212`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/e86d2128adf2a84305f1aa74718bfb2cf084289f) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Discarding a pending change now removes the language it was asked for. On a
  localized collection the discard named no language, so it resolved to the
  default: the editor's Discard threw away the default language's pending
  change while leaving the one on screen, and reset the form to the default
  language's live values.

- [#1008](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1008) [`1cfbe69`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/1cfbe69cc6563ebf64d1ffa34e2c1e9425eb992a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Plugin-contributed fields no longer report themselves as an unknown field type when the list of
  installed plugins fails to load. The list arrives from a session-gated request, and a failed one
  left it empty — which looked exactly like a project with no plugins installed, so a correctly
  installed plugin's field rendered a red "Unknown field type" error. Reloading usually fixed it,
  which made it look like an intermittent fault in the plugin rather than a failed request. The
  field now says the plugin list is unavailable and to reload, and a field whose editor is still
  loading shows a loading state rather than an error.

- [#1081](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1081) [`b5d9429`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/b5d9429426c9ee4f7e83d5a82e30d3538de90bdf) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Code-defined `access` blocks are registered for every config, not only one that
  declares code-first collections. The registration ran inside the collection
  sync, which returns early when there are none, so an app defining only Singles
  never registered their rules — and an unregistered rule does not fail closed,
  it stops applying, falling through to the caller's stored permissions.

- [#1086](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1086) [`4603031`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/46030314646b31181fac2023b1bdbd4fcb46e311) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page builder's `customCss` field and the permission gating it are removed.
  Nothing rendered what the field stored and nothing sanitized it, while a
  permission in front of it implied its safety had been considered — so the change
  that added the missing render call would have had every reason to treat the
  stored text as already clean.

  **Upgrading:** the `customCss` column on the `pages` collection is no longer
  declared, so a schema sync will offer to drop it. Anything stored there was
  never rendered on a page.

  Two type comments claiming this CSS was sanitized and scoped now say plainly
  that it is neither.

- [#1111](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1111) [`56de024`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/56de024d1af68908e738593bbb28fed70908089c) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A surface that needs to edit this site's rich text outside the admin's own field — the page builder's
  canvas is the first — can now load the same node classes and theme the field editor registers, through
  `loadRichTextEditorKit()` on `@nextlyhq/plugin-sdk/admin`.

  Sharing the registry is the point. Lexical recognises content by the identity of the classes that
  wrote it, so an editor built on a different set reads existing rich text as plain text — silently, at
  read time, on documents that already saved.

  The loader is async because the node classes carry Lexical and PrismJS with them, a 630KB chunk the
  admin deliberately keeps behind a dynamic import. Awaiting it is what keeps that weight away from
  consumers who never open an editor.

- [#1121](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1121) [`3b93cd9`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/3b93cd9760d9589d28987bcff801151da310608d) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Rich text can now live in a block and render on a published page. A block prop
  holds exactly what the rich-text field holds — Lexical's serialized tree — so an
  author's rich text is one kind of thing wherever they typed it.

  The type, the format bits and the "is this rich text" test move into
  `blocks-engine`, which the CMS and the renderer both already depend on, and the
  CMS now reads them from there instead of keeping its own. The two cannot share a
  READER: the renderer is forbidden from importing the CMS. They can share a
  DEFINITION, and now do, so the two can only disagree about output and never
  about what the data means. The copies this replaces had already drifted — the
  CMS's test accepted a root with no `children`, which its own serializer could
  only render as empty.

  A stored link URL is now sanitized before it reaches an `href`, through the same
  boundary every other stored URL in the renderer crosses; a destination that
  boundary refuses renders as the author's words rather than as a link. Links keep
  the `target` and `rel` the editor stored. Lexical's three case formats are
  recognised rather than dropped, and horizontal rules, tables, code blocks and
  collapsible sections render as themselves instead of as loose text.

  Two fixes to how stored text is read. A malformed node — a `null` where a node
  belongs — is skipped rather than throwing during the render of a published page.
  And plain-text extraction no longer inserts a space between every text leaf,
  which turned a part-bold `prefix` into `pre fix` for anything reading it for
  search or SEO; separators now fall at block boundaries, and the walk is
  iterative so a deeply nested value cannot exhaust the call stack.

  Dragging a block on the canvas no longer selects its text instead of moving it.
  Blocks are made of text, so a press that lands on a word and then moves is
  ambiguous, and the browser resolved it first: selection begins on the first
  move, while the drag engine waits for the pointer to travel far enough to mean
  a drag. Whether a given press hit a word depended on where the glyphs fell, so
  the same gesture worked or failed depending on the font. The canvas now treats a
  press as a grab, and text being edited opts back in to being selectable.

- [#981](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/981) [`2dc1965`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/2dc19653b80543b8779b6ddb97cd817e4348e1b0) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Scaffolded plugins now enforce Nextly's design-token rules.

  `create-nextly-app --template plugin` previously produced a project with a generic ESLint setup that knew nothing about the admin's design system, so the token contract reached only code written inside Nextly's own repository. A new plugin now depends on `@nextlyhq/eslint-plugin` and extends its recommended config, so a fixed palette colour or an all-constant inline style fails `pnpm lint` in the author's own project and is underlined in their editor.

  The plugin template also installs from the `alpha` dist-tag, joining the blog template. Both track the active release line because the conservative `latest` tag lags it.

- [#1124](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1124) [`ffc68f9`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/ffc68f9c53aeadcdb90ba30098ff399fca6b05a4) Thanks [@faisal-rx](https://github.com/faisal-rx)! - The collection, field group and single schema builders were three near-copies of one page, and an
  edit to any of them was three edits or a divergence. They now draw the same frame, mount the same
  overlays, and reach the same confirmation before a schema change is applied, so the parts that are
  genuinely per-kind — what each entity's settings mean, which client saves it, and what it calls
  itself — are what is left in each page. Nothing a user can see changes; the field name a duplicate
  takes, what a drag does, and which fields count as the user's are now decided in one place instead
  of three that had already begun to drift.

- [#1084](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1084) [`d5efc25`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/d5efc2585fe51b3f78e0975f8584472d32c2366d) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Plugin-contributed fields and the language switcher no longer disappear after
  moving around the admin. The request that lists installed plugins and configured
  locales is session-gated and does not retry, so one made before sign-in failed
  permanently and nothing re-ran it — leaving an author told to reload the page

If you upload images and want thumbnails or configured image sizes, run `npm install sharp`.

  It was a hard dependency of `nextly`, so every install downloaded it: about 18 MB per platform, almost all of it the native libvips binaries. A site with no image uploads, or one using external images, never executed a line of it. Installs that do process images add one command.

  A missing `sharp` now DEGRADES instead of failing. Uploads still succeed and files are still stored; they simply arrive with no thumbnail, no dimensions and no resized copies. Upload security is unchanged, because the check that guards uploads is magic-byte based and never used `sharp`.

  This also fixes a defect that would have made the change unusable. `isValidImage` reported "not an image" whenever it could not run, and the upload route refuses on that with `400 Invalid image file`. An install without the package would therefore have rejected every image upload while blaming the user's file. Image validity now reports three states rather than two, and only a positive finding that a buffer is not an image can refuse an upload.

  The Image Sizes settings page says when the server cannot process images, and names the command that fixes it, so configured sizes that can never be generated no longer fail silently.

  Hosts whose bundler cannot resolve a native module can supply the library directly with `setSharp(sharp)` instead of relying on resolution.

  table silently. An empty leftover table is rebuilt from the new request's fields, so a create
  recorded as applied always matches the columns the table really has; a leftover table that holds
  rows refuses the create and names the table, instead of recording a schema the database does not
  have.

  as the visitor would and needs no database during a build; `createPublicSingleRoute`
  reads trusted and caches under the single's own tags, so publishing updates the
  live page without a rebuild. `createSinglePage` and `createPublicSinglePage`
  render one through the block renderer.

  A single that is missing, or that the visitor may not see, renders as a missing
  page rather than as an error, so the two are indistinguishable from outside. A
  read that fails for any other reason is raised instead of being cached as a
  permanently missing page.

  A structural field stored as `null` — a component or group, `seo: null` in the
  playground — was taken verbatim as the form's default. Its inputs then
  materialise the shape as they register, so the form's values could never equal
  its defaults and the document was dirty from the moment it loaded. Visible as a
  permanent "Not saved" indicator and an always-enabled Save button.

  A stored null for a non-repeatable component or group now falls through to the
  structural default, which is the shape the form will actually hold. Fixed in the
  entry editor too, where the same code carries the same latent defect and only
  avoided it because those documents omit the key rather than storing null.

  With that gone, the unsaved-changes guard is mounted for singles as well: leaving
  a single with real edits now asks first, and leaving an untouched one does not.

  engine has held status-less edits to a published Single since the split shipped,
  but no read returned them and the editor never asked: its Save named the status,
  and a write that names one is never held. So the feature was dark for every
  Single, and an author's held edit was invisible to them.

  Editing a published Single now holds the change instead of putting it on the

A translated Single could only be published one language at a time, through as many writes as it had translations, and a failure partway left the document half-live — some languages public and others not. `POST /api/singles/{slug}/publish-all` moves the main status and every companion `_status` in one transaction, so the state a reader can observe is either the whole document before the publish or the whole document after it. It is authorized as `update-{slug}` plus `publish-{slug}`, with an owner-only or custom publish rule re-judged against the row under its lock, and it records the same `single.updated` and per-language `single.published` events an ordinary write does. The admin offers "Publish all" on a localized Single with a draft/published lifecycle, alongside the entry editor's.

  `SiteSheetInput` had no `mayFetchUrl` member, so `compileSiteSheet` compiled the
  named-class and block-default tiers with no host question asked — while
  `PageRenderer` passed `remotePatterns` into the page compile for node styles.
  A stored class naming a host the site refuses was therefore emitted into the
  sheet of every page, and the site sheet is emitted first, where a page sheet
  that merely omits a declaration cannot retract one.

  `SiteSheetInput` now accepts `mayFetchUrl` and threads it into its
  `compilePageCss` call. `effectiveCompile` returns the predicate it derives so
  `PageRenderer` hands the same function to both sheets: reading it off the
  reconciled compile context would have asked nothing on the ordinary production
  path, where a consumer rendering a stored artifact supplies no style context and
  that context is `undefined`.

  No `fetchPolicyId` counterpart on this input. That stamp exists so a reader can
  tell whether a stored sheet predates the current rules; this artifact is
  compiled per render and addressed by the hash of its own bytes, so a policy that
  changes what is emitted changes the name.

  A site that configured no `remotePatterns` is unchanged — absent is unasked, not
  an empty allowlist.

  A named class is emitted verbatim into the sheet of every public page, and the
  Site Style write gate never read inside its `styles`. `isUsableNamedClass` types
  the envelope and stops there, so a class carrying
  `background: { url: "https://tracker.example/p.png" }` was stored, compiled and
  served to every visitor of every page — while the identical value written on a
  node was refused, because the renderer polices node styles and nothing policed
  the site sheet.

  The classes field now runs each entry's values through the engine's own
  `validateStyleValues` with the site's `remotePatterns` predicate, derived through
  the same `isFetchableUrl` the published page and the canvas use. Only errors
  refuse a write: a warning is a value the engine accepts and emits.

  How strictly an unrecognised property is judged now depends on whether the site
  configured a host policy, because the validator does not look INSIDE one.
  - **No `remotePatterns`: forgiving, and nothing changes.** A property written by
    a newer engine stays a warning, and an absent policy is treated as unasked
    rather than as an empty allowlist.
  - **`remotePatterns` configured: strict.** An unrecognised property is an error
    and the write is refused, because a value the gate cannot judge could carry a
    `url()` it will never see. Such a site can no longer store a property this
    engine does not know, and is told which one.

  Validation is also bounded now. One issue budget covers the whole classes
  section rather than each property map, and the walk stops once it is spent —
  between maps inside a class and between classes. A payload spreading invalid
  properties across many maps could otherwise ask for work proportional to the
  map count, which the document byte cap alone does not limit.

  classes and breakpoints — now persist. The page builder registers a versioned Site Style
  single that stores admin edits, layered over optional code-stated defaults on
  `pageBuilder({ siteStyle })`; one merge resolves the two, writes are validated with the
  engine's own rules and refused on garbage, and a published route passes the merged result
  per request via `loadSiteStyle`, so a stored token or class reaches the served page's site
  sheet without a redeploy.

  The Site Style single declared `access: { read: () => true }`, which cannot
  serve the anonymous page render it was written for and does reach every
  authenticated principal. `checkAccess` refuses an absent user before
  consulting any rule, singles are not public endpoints, and a published page
  never uses the route — `loadSiteStyle` reads through the Direct API, whose
  `overrideAccess` default returns before a rule is evaluated. What the rule
  did do was return ahead of the `read-site-style` permission lookup, and the
  `read` action covers the version list, a version, a version diff and the
  autosave recovery point as well as the published document.

  The access block is gone, so read and update alike fall through to the
  permissions seeded with the single. A published render is unchanged; a role
  that should read this document is granted `read-site-style`.

- [#1133](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1133) [`4672cd8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/4672cd884c684076056c3ecd1df5c832496f1e40) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - fix(blocks-react): resolve every shared site-style input once per render

  A render carries two style inputs — the route's `styleContext` and the site's
  `siteStyles` — and compiles twice from them: the shared sheet, and the page's
  own values. Only the class library was reconciled between them. `breakpoints`,
  `tokenPrefix` and `blockBases` were each computed twice, so a stored value that
  reached the sheet never reached the page compile.

  The consequences were silent, because each sheet is internally consistent and
  neither reports anything. A stored breakpoint set replaces the config one
  whole, so a node's value stored under an id the route's set lacks was dropped
  outright; a stored token prefix left every `{ $token }` reference pointing at a
  custom property nothing declared, and an unresolved custom property invalidates
  the declaration rather than reporting.

  `PageRenderer` now resolves the shared inputs once and gives the same values to
  both compiles. Precedence is unchanged for every field — the defect was two
  computations of one question, not the wrong answer to it. A table typed over
  every `SiteSheetInput` key records which side each belongs on, so a field added
  there is a compile error until someone says.

  **Breaking, alpha:** a `siteStyles` PROVIDER is now `{ read, singles }` rather
  than a bare function. Being called per render is not the same as being read per
  render — on a pre-rendered route the whole render is cached and only a tag the
  page carries rebuilds it, while a Direct API read inside the provider
  contributes none. `singles` names the slugs that read consults, which puts
  `nextly:single:<slug>` on the route, so an admin's save reaches the next page
  view as the documentation already promised.

  The two are one type rather than a value and a separate optional property,
  because an optional one leaves the unsafe configuration legal: a provider with
  no declared dependencies compiles, serves a stale sheet, and looks exactly like
  a correct route. `singles: []` states that a provider reads no singles. A plain
  value needs none of this — it cannot change after the module loaded.

  The Site Style write validators also judged the stored tier alone, while every
  consumer compiles the merge. Config entries are inserted first and both engine
  resolutions are first-wins, so a stored class whose slug a config class already
  holds was accepted, then dropped at render, leaving the node that referenced it
  with no rule — and `MAX_NAMED_CLASSES` was counted over the stored array while
  the compiler truncates the merged one. Both are judged against the merge now,
  when a caller states its config tier. Token collisions are reported as the
  DIFFERENCE the write introduces, so a site whose own config already emits an
  issue does not have someone else's mistake charged to the admin saving a token.

  The configured breakpoint set threaded into the blocks field validator judges no
  document, and that is now recorded as the deliberate limit it is rather than
  left looking like an oversight. Making it strict was tried and is wrong while
  the set reaching that call is the config tier alone, resolved at config time
  where there is no database: a page styled at a breakpoint an admin STORED would
  be refused on save while the published renderer compiles it. The parameter keeps
  deciding the one property that is true of the set alone — ids colliding across
  axes — and becomes load-bearing for documents once something can reach the
  stored tier.

  `blocks-engine` now exports `usableNamedClasses` and `usableNamedClassPositions`
  — the list the compiler writes and the renderer is handed, ordering and claim
  rules included.

  The Site Style write gate uses it to answer the only question an author cares
  about: will the class I just wrote render? It compares the ids that resolve
  before and after the write, so it reports a class the write adds that cannot
  render, and a class the site used to render that the write displaces — whether
  by claiming its slug, taking its id, reordering it behind another, or pushing
  it past the cap.

  Modelling that instead of asking was wrong four separate ways in review, each a
  different rule: the merge is keyed by id so a shared id REPLACES rather than
  duplicates, a config tier's own problems are not the writer's to fix, two
  collisions on one slug read identically as messages, and the compiler claims
  slugs after sorting by `orderIndex` rather than in array order. Asking cannot be
  wrong in any of them.

  `SiteToken` gains an optional `id`. A token identity is its `id` when it has one and its `name` otherwise, and both the emitted custom property and the config/stored tier merge key on that identity rather than on the name. Every token stored before the field existed carries no id, so its identity is its name and it emits exactly the property it emitted before — nothing migrates. Renaming pins the identity at the name the token already had and moves only the label, which is what keeps existing references resolving.

  Because an id and a name share one custom-property space, renaming frees the label but not the property behind it: a new token claiming the freed name is refused and named rather than allowed to shadow the token that left it.

  DTCG import and export carry the identity under the `com.nextlyhq.nextly` extension key, which is the only place the format allows it — DTCG has no token id of its own and reserves the `$` prefix. A file from another tool carries no such key and imports with its names for identities rather than having one invented for it.

Which controls a style
  property offers is now derived from the engine's own catalog rather than listed anywhere, so a
  property added to the catalog gains an editor with no control code written; a leaf kind the
  catalog grows that this build has no control for appears as a known gap instead of vanishing.
  Reading and writing a control's value goes through one address — state, breakpoint, property and
  the path inside it — so nothing spells that path a second time, and every value is checked by the
  catalog's own validator rather than by a control's idea of it. Dragging a value previews it by
  compiling the same declarations the published stylesheet carries, so a token still resolves to the
  custom property it resolves to on the page and a value the compiler would refuse never reaches the
  screen; releasing writes one operation, which is one step of undo. Whether a value was authored
  here, inherited from a class or never set is read from the record the compiler already writes, so
  a control cannot disagree with the page about where a value came from. No controls render yet.

It was correct while colours were hex and fails silently now that they are tokens, which is why it survives review. The design-lint guard gains the same rule for stylesheets, plus a named-colour check: `color: rebeccapurple`is as fixed as`#663399`, and a token DEFINED as a named colour quietly ends the aliasing that a whole namespace's contrast depends on.

  The guard also now reads `packages/builder/src`, the editor's entire interface and previously the largest first-party UI surface no design check covered. Its `--nx-builder-*` namespace stays; these rules never cared which namespace a token belongs to, only whether a colour was written down instead of referenced.

  The density thresholds were measured against the toolbar row, which carries its
  own horizontal padding. The container they are queried against then moved to the
  header's sticky wrapper, which has none — so each query saw a box 48px wider
  than the space actually available, and every label held on 48px longer than
  intended.

  The effect was measurable rather than theoretical: at a 792px row the labels
  stayed at full width, leaving the title pinned to its minimum with no slack,
  where collapsing them gives it 290px.

  The thresholds now carry that padding explicitly.

- [#1017](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1017) [`133a749`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/133a749a1548869f5378583526e43c2254b4f647) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The document header no longer overflows on a phone.

  Collapsing labels recovered enough width for the title down to about 540px, and
  below that there is simply not enough room for a title and a row of controls
  side by side: even with every label already reduced to its icon the cluster
  needs around 370px, against 294px of usable width on a 390px screen.

  So below 32rem the header wraps instead. The title takes its own line and the
  controls sit beneath it, wrapping among themselves rather than running off the
  edge. Nothing is hidden and nothing is clipped; the header is taller on a phone,
  which is the dimension a phone has to spare.

- [#1015](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1015) [`e1f4612`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/e1f4612d1607ec904d4b47071f1792a990098283) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The document header's title input no longer collapses.

  The title was a `flex-1` beside an action cluster that never shrank, so it got
  whatever was left: measured on `main`, `row - 598px`, which is 34px in a
  1280-wide window and 0 at 900. It reproduced on non-localized collections too,
  so this was general header behaviour rather than anything about translations.

  Actions now yield before the title does. As the toolbar narrows, supporting
  labels (preview, copy link) drop to their icons, then publish and unpublish do;
  the primary Save never collapses, and the title keeps a readable floor. A
  collapsed label becomes `sr-only` rather than being removed, so every control
  keeps the accessible name it had at full width.

  The queries read the toolbar's own width rather than the viewport's, because the
  document rail is 320px wide and hides at its own breakpoint — one window width
  produces two different toolbar widths, and only the toolbar knows how much room
  the toolbar has.

A translator working a non-default language could previously see the source only as an inline hint under each field, and that hint could render a string or a number and nothing else — so a richText body, a relationship or a chips list had no source text on screen at all, silently. The new mode renders the source through the editor's own field components, so whatever a field can draw the source shows.

  The language pair lives in the URL (`?locale=es&translate=en`), which makes it linkable, reload-safe and reachable with the back button, and makes entering or leaving it a navigation the unsaved-changes guard can see. While the mode is on the admin's navigation, sub-sidebar, header and page frame step aside, and the mode renders its own way back — the suppression layer grants the navigation rail only to a surface that says it can be left.

  The source pane is read-only and shows only the translatable fields: a shared field holds the same value in both languages, so putting it there would fill half the screen with a copy of what is already in the other pane.

  The translation overview said whether each language was translated and whether
  it was live, but not whether someone had saved work in it that was never
  published. An editor could only find that out by opening each language in turn,
  so on a document with several it went unnoticed.

- [#1048](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1048) [`175b6fa`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/175b6fa154f7052588470b50ca73fcef8fdb6d45) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Translation mode now reports progress and can fill a single field from the source. A translator sees how many of this language's fields are done, counted as they type rather than from what was last saved, and each translatable field offers "Use source" where the source has text — for the lines that are the same in both languages, a name, a URL, a product term. The document-level copy still exists for seeding a whole language; this is the grain the side-by-side view makes possible.

  Also fixes two layout defects found by measuring rather than looking. The editor cancels its page container's padding with a negative margin, and inside a translation pane there was no padding to cancel — so its layout was 64px wider than the pane it sat in and the document rail was drawn past the right edge. And a language row in the 320px rail put its label, badges, state and two buttons on one unshrinkable line, which left an untranslated right-to-left language's "Open" button 38px outside the row, unreachable by pointer; that one was not new, and happened on the ordinary editor too.

- [#1053](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1053) [`782cf82`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/782cf82ffa502b3af3467f1166e7ce16dc63658c) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Let a host keep its Alt shortcuts while the layers tree has focus. Reordering blocks with alt+arrow did nothing when focus sat in the page editor's layers panel, because the tree read the arrow key without checking modifiers and moved its own focus instead.

- [#1047](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1047) [`8ff87ca`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/8ff87ca56860026497be0c97cb603e369a09f05d) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The tree view can show more than one row selected, and the page builder layers panel now highlights everything the canvas does. Rows can be added to the selection with Cmd or Ctrl click and a run selected with Shift click, from the keyboard as well as the pointer.

- [#1010](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1010) [`e41222f`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/e41222fead5a69407c2a99914fa6b41ede864e9f) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The entry and single editors get a language panel: one place that says what
  state every language is in and carries the actions that follow from it, in the
  document rail where there is room and inline where there is not, so the
  language workflow can no longer be the surface that disappears at narrow
  widths.

  Singles can now copy content from another language. The action used to gate on
  a collection slug and an entry id, which is how an entry is addressed rather
  than anything the action needs, so it was collection-only by accident; both
  editors now supply the read themselves and it gates on being able to read a
  source.

  Switching languages is withheld while a past version is on screen, alongside
  the mutations it already withheld, and each language row's controls name the
  language they act on.

- [#1065](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1065) [`fb05a08`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/fb05a08b9c4605091f3aa151ce2d3ac86f3e4640) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Key a pending change by the language it belongs to, and clean it up correctly.

  Deleting a document now removes its pending changes in every language rather
  than only the unlocalized one, which would otherwise leave rows behind pointing
  at a document that no longer exists. A write that cannot name the language it is
  for no longer stores a pending change under the wrong key, where nothing would
  find it again.

- [#1059](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1059) [`9f57bb3`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/9f57bb3e674d02daace62f12c9b2d39570846aa8) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Hold a document to one pending change per language in the database.

  A working draft is the only row class the version table's sequence index cannot
  constrain: it carries no version number, and SQL treats NULL as distinct from
  NULL. A dedicated key column, set only on that row class, lets one ordinary
  unique index enforce the rule on every dialect, so two writers can no longer
  each store a pending change for the same document and language.

### Patch Changes

- [#995](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/995) [`205ac43`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/205ac43ecab968ba3346863773a17fc497bffe02) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The admin and `@nextlyhq/ui` now enforce the same design-token rules shipped to plugin authors.

  Twelve inline styles became utility classes, so those surfaces follow the theme and the spacing scale rather than fixed values. The page-builder drop indicator was painted a fixed `deepskyblue` that ignored light and dark mode entirely; it now uses the primary token.

  The email preview's palette is named in one place and documented as deliberately literal — mail clients do not resolve CSS custom properties, so a preview built from admin tokens would show authors something recipients never receive.

  A `design-lint-ok` exemption now annotates the construct it precedes rather than a single line, so a multi-line declaration needs its reason recorded once. The reach is bounded and cannot extend past a function.

- [#990](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/990) [`da50ecb`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/da50ecb035f86c11e60e50f85497b2ca6cf81364) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Outline badges now show the border colour they are given. Seven places in the admin ask one for a
  specific colour — a green edge on an enabled plugin, red and blue on submission states — and every
  one was quietly drawn in the default grey instead. The enabled-plugin pill in particular asked for
  a stronger green so its edge stays visible against the background, and did not get it.

- [#999](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/999) [`f9dbc5f`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/f9dbc5f86d51fda80b6fd7f2109aa387cd9a5fe8) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Restoring a version is now offered from the historical-document banner: the entry form passes its restore handler through, so an authorised reader sees the action beside the version they are reading rather than nowhere at all.

- [#1005](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1005) [`8df7086`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/8df7086c2eaca7634d6350115394547a6aa05b80) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The entry editor's language tools are now visible, reachable, and legible.

  In a localized collection, the document title was invisible: the language strip shared its header row and squeezed the title input to zero width at every screen size. The title now has its own row, with languages on a row of their own beneath it.

  One segmented control shows every language with its state (published, translated, draft, or not translated — carried by shape and text, never colour alone) and switches between them; it replaces the separate dropdown and pill row that both switched languages. A Languages menu in the header offers Copy from and Publish all languages at every screen width — previously those lived only in a side panel that disappears on smaller screens — along with a legend for the language states.

  Creating an entry now says which language it will be created in. The "Shared across languages" badge appears only while editing a non-default language, where it matters. If a language fails to load, the editor offers the way back to the default language instead of only an exit.

- [#985](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/985) [`2d11910`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/2d1191061664111851c30b1739c859a309a51399) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The collection-entries list now remembers your column choice the same way every other admin list
  does. Behaviour is unchanged — it already remembered — but it is one mechanism now rather than
  two, so the lists cannot drift apart.

- [#984](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/984) [`811c4bf`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/811c4bf653ea40129d4448b01452f533bdf50bc8) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A field rendered twice on one page no longer collides with itself. A field's DOM id was its path,
  which is unique within a form and not within a page — so showing a past version beside the live
  editor gave both copies the same ids, and every label in the version panel pointed at the live
  editor's control instead. Those fields lost their accessible name, and clicking one of their labels
  moved focus into the editable document. Ids are now scoped per rendering; the live editor's ids are
  unchanged.

- [#996](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/996) [`42f0c1e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/42f0c1e669f1634064d1d90a63790b8cf8c24e46) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Reading a past version is now read-only all the way through, and can be acted on from where it is
  read. The save controls stand down while a version is on screen — they act on the live document,
  which is not what is being read — and restoring is offered from the banner over the version itself.

  Three things that stayed editable are fixed with it. The title and the slug are part of the
  document, so they lock with the rest of it rather than quietly changing the live entry from a
  historical page. The set of fields a version shows is now decided by that version's own values, so
  a document whose layout has changed since is not shown through today's layout. And returning to the
  live document clears the panel's selection too, so no row stays marked as the version on screen.

- [#994](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/994) [`85d0d97`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/85d0d97945abab5797f18da63e6d9f7e21580a87) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Version history reads in the document now. Choosing a version from the panel renders it where the
  document is, read-only, with a banner naming which version is on screen and a way back to the live
  one — instead of squeezing a page into a 480px column beside it. The panel keeps the timeline.

  The live document is untouched throughout: the historical values are rendered against a form of
  their own, so nothing typed is disturbed by opening history and nothing historical can reach a save
  or an autosave. An empty history now leads with a heading rather than a sentence, because when the
  panel is empty that line is the only thing in it.

- [#989](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/989) [`ff2fb60`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/ff2fb60ba340d08063c63f68b39df06d72b0cc57) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A JSON field's parse error is announced again. Scoping field ids moved the error node without
  moving the reference to it, so in a version preview the control described an element that did not
  exist — and a dangling description reaches assistive technology as no description at all, which is
  worse than the plain error it replaced.

- [#980](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/980) [`fad081c`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/fad081c242f6e04ae72a3ecf352a38da73f57fda) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Every admin list now remembers which columns you hid. Previously only collection entries did, so
  narrowing a wide table anywhere else lasted until you closed the tab. Each list keeps its own
  choice, so hiding a column on Users does not change what Roles shows you.

- [#1002](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1002) [`b903379`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/b903379ae597168156d4ece4b8622d340be96ad5) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - `no-hardcoded-colors` now catches CSS named colours.

  The rule already rejected hex, `rgb()`, `hsl()` and `oklch()`, but a name like `deepskyblue` passed — which is how a fixed colour that ignores light and dark mode sat on the page-builder's drop indicator until it was found by reading a file flagged for something else.

  A colour name is an ordinary word, so it is reported only where its position makes it a colour: the value of a colour-valued style property, or the right-hand side of a CSS declaration. Prose and data are untouched — `"the red team"`, `{ fruit: "plum" }` and a label reading `"Tomato"` are all fine. `black`, `white` and `transparent` stay exempt, as their hex spellings already were.

  The rules also stop applying to test files, matching the repository's CSS guard. A fixture writing `color: red` is modelling arbitrary user data rather than styling a surface that ships.

- [#982](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/982) [`ea623f2`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/ea623f2c06cfb57366f6debc1e613c1c84fb42eb) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Plugins can now actually place their sidebar menu items, and the type describing where they go is importable.

  The previous release accepted a `section` declaration on menu items and then ignored it: every item was flattened into one list rendered under Plugins, so a plugin placed under Settings had its pages in one panel and its menu items in another. Items are now attributed through the same chain a plugin's pages use — the item's own declaration, then the plugin's placement, then Plugins.

  `PluginNavSection`, the type the field is declared with, was also missing from both the `nextly` root and `@nextlyhq/plugin-sdk`, so a plugin author could not import it.

- [#1004](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1004) [`9b27446`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/9b274464cbcc28e48637876cae0ef4d1b76d7b01) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A scaffolded plugin no longer bundles a copy of `@nextlyhq/ui`.

  The UI kit is supplied by the host admin at run time, but the plugin template declared it only as a devDependency — and tsup externalises peer dependencies while bundling dev ones, so the entire kit was inlined into every published plugin. It is now declared as a peer, matching the first-party plugins, and named in the template's externals.

- [#986](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/986) [`e56dddb`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/e56dddb31483d0e76f5dbeaca2681d55c42f398e) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Fix five further defects in `@nextlyhq/eslint-plugin` and its guard.

  `no-static-inline-style` reported a computed style key as constant. `{ [cssProperty]: 8 }` styles whichever property the variable holds, so the declaration is runtime-dependent and the rule was rejecting correct code.

  `no-hardcoded-colors` did not detect `oklch()` or `oklab()` literals, which matters more than the older spellings because Nextly's tokens are themselves OKLCH.

  The `design-lint-ok` exemption was matched by substring, so a bare marker silenced a rule while recording no reason, and unrelated text containing the marker silenced one by accident. It is now a directive that must carry a reason.

  `@nextlyhq/plugin-sdk` imported the design-token config without applying it, so its own lint never ran these rules.

- [#988](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/988) [`03cd7d8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/03cd7d81bd3e830079217110d8bd8d32cafefbf1) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The line under the selected tab now follows the theme. It was marked so that nothing could
  override it, which made it the one piece of admin colour a retheme could not reach.

- [#1003](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/1003) [`03e5182`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/03e518254e640114fafd8251841b9ed58a88959a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Reading a past version now waits for the snapshot to arrive before showing it or offering to restore it. A version read that has not returned reports neither progress nor failure, which previously rendered an empty document as though it were the version and enabled restore for a version nobody had seen.

### Patch Changes

- [#957](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/957) [`bf1477a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/bf1477aa82fdcca011b955a8764d1a2848e7e04b) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - An added or removed text field showed a blank space on the version it never reached, instead of
  saying it was not present there. Splitting an inline text diff leaves one side with no runs at
  all, and an empty paragraph reads as a field that existed and held nothing. Which side a field
  never reached is now decided in one place for every kind of field, so a renderer cannot answer it
  differently.

- [#907](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/907) [`1cb27c2`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/1cb27c201fef195bd470c3d7bd54d4621dfb6610) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - fix(admin): show the recovery-point indicator before the first recording

  The entry header hid the indicator until a recording had happened, so the first
  edit to a saved entry showed nothing for the whole debounce window, which is
  exactly when a reader most needs telling their change is not stored yet.

  The header now asks only whether recording is possible at all. AutoSaveIndicator
  already returns nothing when it has no state to report, so the header restating
  that was a duplicate that could disagree with it.

  The indicator copy also described a local draft, which it no longer is.

- [#912](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/912) [`70ab60f`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/70ab60f8dfac2bb5b231f04c217ba555ef1596ac) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - feat(admin): offer recovered work back when an editor opens

  Recording without offering is a loop that never closes: the work was stored and
  nobody was ever told it existed. The entry editor now reads the calling author
  own recovery point on open and offers it back.

  A non-blocking strip above the fields rather than a modal. A modal suited the
  older local draft, which was almost always your own work from a tab that had
  just crashed. A server recovery point is a wider set, including work from
  another device or from days ago, so demanding an answer before the document can
  be read turns a rescue into an obstacle.

  An offer is withheld when the document was saved after the recovery point, and
  made anyway when the document timestamp is unknown: a spurious offer costs one
  dismissal, while a suppressed one loses work recorded specifically so it could
  not be lost.

- [#900](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/900) [`01b32a2`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/01b32a21c45c52e9cdd90c5464cbf86743a3c2ff) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - feat(admin): add the autosave transport to versionApi

  The autosave endpoints had no client. protectedApi carried no PUT verb at all,
  so the write endpoint was unreachable from the admin regardless of which caller
  wanted it.

  Adds the verb, and the two calls that use it: recording the values currently in
  the editor as the calling author's recovery point, and reading that back.
  PUT rather than POST because the row is rolling, one per document and author
  rewritten in place, so sending the same snapshot twice leaves one recovery
  point and an unacknowledged retry is safe.

- [#906](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/906) [`8efeff5`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/8efeff5b4d6c83936629a8594ef493cc4450cff5) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - feat(admin): record recovery points from the entry editor

  Mounts the autosave hook in the entry editor and shows its state in the header
  action cluster, which is what makes server-side recovery points reachable for
  the first time: the endpoints, the transport and the hook all existed with
  nothing calling them.

  Recording engages only once an entry has an id, since the endpoint addresses a
  document that exists, and pauses while a real save is in flight so a snapshot
  cannot describe a state that never existed.

- [#931](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/931) [`8ff3ed3`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/8ff3ed33e40a9f6b238eecea889249f6086f9cd0) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The page editor now takes the whole window. The admin's sidebars, header and page frame step aside while an immersive surface is mounted, and restore themselves when you leave it.

- [#902](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/902) [`67926e3`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/67926e3f70c5c17f40c2b424fe20fec4b1e6c727) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - feat(admin): record the editor values as a server-side recovery point

  A debounced hook that writes the values currently in the form to the calling
  author rolling recovery point, and reports the status back.

  It is not a save. The dirty flag is left exactly as the form set it, so the
  unsaved-changes guard goes on firing, and the values are read with getValues
  rather than through handleSubmit, which validates and refuses on failure and
  would therefore record nothing for the half-finished input most worth keeping.

  Recording is triggered by the dirty flag rather than by the update type, which
  react-hook-form leaves undefined for any change that does not come from a
  registered input own DOM handler.

- [#898](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/898) [`9ea28f1`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/9ea28f10c0b49f3161e4ad7f4acf394aa09b3fdd) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - fix(admin): put seven more admin form pages on the shared layout

  The API key, role, settings, webhook and user-field forms now consume
  `FormLayout`, `FormActions`, `FieldShell` and `Grid` from `@nextlyhq/ui`
  instead of hand-rolled page padding, a fixed action row, `SettingsRow`'s
  horizontal label-left/control-right grid, and viewport-breakpoint grids.

  Converted: `CreateApiKeyForm`, `EditApiKeyForm`, `RoleForm` (with
  `RoleBasicInfo`), `ImageSizeForm`, `EmailProviderForm` (with
  `ProviderConfigFields`), the general settings page, `WebhookForm`,
  `UserFieldForm`, and the Full Name/Email/Password fields in
  `UserFormFields`. Every compound `Select` field among them (API key Token
  Duration/Type/Role, Image Size Resize Mode/Format, general settings
  Timezone/Date Format/Time Format, and each provider config field's `select`
  kind) now wires its `SelectTrigger` through `FieldShell`'s render-function
  `children`, the same pattern the form builder's conversion established.

  Composite controls with no single focusable element to attach an id to are
  named as GROUPS instead, via `SettingsRowGroup`: `ProviderTypePicker`, the
  webhook event-type checkbox group and the webhook custom-headers row each get
  `role="group"` with `aria-labelledby` rather than a `<label for>` aimed at a
  control that never carries the id. Measured in a browser before and after: all
  three pointed at nothing in both light and dark themes.

  Left hand-rolled, each with its own comment: `FieldTypePicker` and the
  sign-in-method `RadioGroup`; horizontal label-left/switch-right settings rows
  (`UserFieldForm`'s "Allow multiple selections", "Required" and "Active");
  read-only value rows with no control at all (`EditApiKeyForm`'s Key
  Properties); and one page grid needing an asymmetric row/column gap `Grid`'s
  `gap` prop cannot express (`UserFormFields`'s two-column split).

  `RoleBasicInfo.test.tsx` — failing on `main` before this change, asserting
  placeholders, descriptions and a system-role message the component has never
  rendered — is repaired to match what the component actually renders.

- [#872](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/872) [`1dd9b90`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/1dd9b90cfe67c220ddf12495d6d6126b4bd76f45) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - feat(ui): add a shared admin form layout layer

  A shared form layout layer for the admin: a named field-width vocabulary for
  consistently sized controls, section chrome composed from the existing card,
  a single page-level action bar, and an opt-in responsive mode on the existing
  grid.

  `FieldShell` associates its label with whichever id actually ends up on the
  control (a caller's own id or a generated one, never an explicitly-`undefined`
  one), composes `aria-describedby` with whatever the control already carries
  rather than replacing it, and forces `aria-invalid` when `error` is rendered
  even if the control claims otherwise. It owns this prop merge itself with
  `cloneElement` instead of Radix `Slot`, warns in development rather than
  silently disconnecting when handed a `Fragment`, and narrows `children` to a
  single element to match what it can actually slot in. `FormSection` names its
  region with `aria-labelledby`. `Grid`'s `responsive` mode now splits
  `className`/`style`/`ref` (parent-layout concerns) from `cols`/`gap` (internal
  layout) between its wrapper and inner grid; non-responsive mode is unchanged.

- [#929](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/929) [`7fa0cc2`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/7fa0cc27abfab02cf2e960f616848106f4b99b8c) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - fix(admin): send the autosave snapshot as the request body

  Restoring a recovery point put nothing back in the form.

  The autosave endpoint treats the request BODY as the snapshot and reads the
  locale from the request params. The client wrapped the values in an envelope
  instead, so that envelope was stored as the snapshot and every field ended up
  one level too deep; a restore then wrote an object with no field names the form
  recognised. The locale it carried in the body was never read.

  Also enables drafts and autosave on the playground posts collection. No

  The helper required a string, so every call site supplied its own empty-string
  fallback. That put one rule in two places: the helper, which its tests reach,
  and a fallback at each caller, which they do not.

  Accepting null and undefined removes the fallback rather than testing it, so
  there is no longer a per-caller decision to get wrong.

  Saving now deletes the saving author recovery point, on both the collection and
  Single write paths, inside the write transaction.

  This removes a comparison that could not be made correctly. Deciding whether to
  offer recovered work compared a version timestamp against a document timestamp,
  and those live in different tables that do not share a clock: one records UTC
  and the other local time carrying a Z. The comparison was wrong by the server
  offset and silently withheld every offer on a Single. A row that exists only
  while there is unsaved work needs no comparison.

  Scoped to the saving author, so another editor unsaved work survives. Inside the
  transaction, so a failed save leaves the recovery point rather than destroying
  the only copy of work it did not store.

  Also moves the Single recovery banner into the main column: above the flex row
  it sat under the sticky header, which intercepted pointer events, so the offer
  was visible and its buttons were not clickable.

  The save changes the database tables first and then records what it did. If that recording step failed, the failure was written to the server console and the response still said the schema had been applied. The tables held the new shape, the stored definition still described the old one, and nothing marked the field group as needing repair.

  That was worse than it sounds, because the version number was deliberately left where it was. An editor already open would therefore pass its staleness check and plan its next change from a shape the database no longer had — the exact retry the `diverged` state exists to refuse, arriving through the one path that never marked it.

  A failed recording is now recorded. The field group is marked `diverged`, and the response says which of three things actually happened, because the operator's next step differs for each: the failure was marked, so reconcile and do not retry; the record turned out to have moved on, so reload before doing anything, since the change was probably saved and the field group may also have been deleted; or nothing could be recorded at all, so the server log is the only trace.

  One case that used to be reported as a failure now correctly reports success. MySQL has no `RETURNING`, so a write is an update followed by a read, and a read that fails after the update has already committed used to be treated as though nothing was written. The save now re-reads the row and reports success when it already carries the change.

  Dragging was the only way to reorder a block, so the editor could not be used by
  anyone who does not use a pointer.

  `keyboardMovePosition` answers where the selected block goes for four intents,
  split across two axes so that each has an inverse: `up` / `down` reorder among
  siblings and never change the parent, `indent` / `outdent` change the parent and
  never reorder anything that stays put. Every press is undone by the opposite
  press, which is what lets someone driving the editor without sight of the result
  recover from a mistaken key.

  It reports what the move DOES as well as where it lands, so the wiring can
  announce "moved down" and "moved into Group" differently without re-deriving the
  difference by comparing parents. Moves that change parent also name the slot they
  vacate, because a keyboard author moves one block at a time and emptying a
  container is the common case rather than the rare one.

  One asymmetry is deliberate and pinned by a test: `indent` appends, so outdenting
  a block that was not its container's last child and indenting it back returns it
  at the end. Recovering the original index would mean carrying state across
  presses.

  Not yet exported from any entry point: it has no consumer until the canvas wires
  it up.

  A pointer resting near the boundary between two drop targets jitters by a pixel
  or two and the target underneath it alternates, which shows as a flickering
  insertion indicator and as a block landing where the author did not aim.

  `nextTargetSwitchState` makes a rival target hold while the pointer travels a set
  distance before it replaces the committed one. It reads two points and a number
  and no geometry at all, so a 1px divider, an author-set 0px spacer, a 900px hero,
  a vertical stack and a grid all behave identically — a minimum-size rule cannot
  say that, because a spacer's height has no lower bound and any pixel floor makes
  some authored block impossible to drop beside.

  The threshold is measured from where the candidate first differed from the
  committed target, not from where the last switch happened. The latter is
  satisfied by construction before the pointer reaches any seam, so it would be met
  exactly where it is not needed and never where it is.

  Not yet exported from any entry point: it has no consumer until a canvas wires it
  up, and an unused public export is a surface with no caller to keep it honest.

  `core/card` declined a background and a border for as long as no design token
  resolved. Both `color.surface` and `color.border` are now in the guaranteed set
  and both render paths emit the sheet that defines them, so the block carries
  them — as `{ $token }` references rather than literals, because a literal colour
  is wrong in whichever of light and dark it was not chosen for, which is the whole
  reason a token set exists. The border is written per LOGICAL side, so a
  right-to-left page borders the side an author means.

  This also DELETES the ratchet that forbade `{ $token }` in `baseStyles`, which is
  the swap it was written for: its stated expiry was "when the site stylesheet is
  wired into the render path", and both paths now emit it. It is replaced by the
  question that matters now — a default may only name a token the guaranteed set
  DEFINES, because a reference to an undefined name dangles for exactly the reason
  the old defect did, and neither the catalog check nor the compiled-CSS check can
  see it.

  A field-group storage migration renames the registry table and every field group's data table. Two paths could previously run at the same time as one: the code-first sync that materialises field groups defined in your config at boot and on hot reload, and the `db:sync` pass that deletes field groups no longer present in code.

  The deletion pass was the more consequential of the two. It reads the table names first and then drops them one at a time, so a migration renaming those tables partway through left the remaining drops addressing names that no longer existed. Because those statements are `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`, that failed silently: the field group survived as a table nothing scanned for again. The exclusion is now held across the whole pass rather than per field group, so the names it read stay valid until it finishes.

  The code-first sync writes definition rows only and creates no tables, so it holds the migration out without being able to create the lock itself — a deployment whose database role has permission to write rows but not to create tables keeps booting exactly as before.

  Neither path changes what it does when no migration is running.

  Two blocks the derived block list marks as needed by every site inventoried,
  including a client project.

  `core/card` is a preset over the shared container implementation, differing
  from a box only in what it starts as: rounded and clipping. The clip is the
  substance rather than the rounding, because a border radius paints the box and
  does not constrain its descendants, so a card that rounds without clipping
  renders a child image's square corners over its own curve. It carries no
  default padding, because padding on the card makes a full-bleed image
  impossible; and no default background or border, because the guaranteed token
  set has no surface or border colour and a hardcoded one is wrong in whichever
  of light and dark it was not chosen for.

  `core/form` renders plain HTML and ships no client JavaScript — the
  form-builder plugin remains the one that stores submissions, and contributes no
  block of its own, so the two do not compete. Its whole layout is one grid on
  the root, so every label and control is a direct child rather than nested;
  labels associate by `htmlFor` and an id derived from the node's id, so two
  forms on one page cannot mint the same id and re-point one form's label at
  another's field. The `action` is read through the same URL guard the other
  blocks use, so a stored scheme that executes rather than navigates is refused.

  `base-styles.test.tsx` is derived from `coreBlocks` rather than listing blocks
  by hand: it asserts that every property a block declares in `baseStyles` is
  known to `STYLE_CATALOG` and reaches the compiled stylesheet under that block's
  own selector. Those are separate questions — a catalog property is still
  dropped when its value does not match the grammar the catalog declares for it —
  and the pair covers the failure that shipped in `core/columns`, whose first
  version declared a flex item property the catalog does not carry and which the
  compiler dropped silently while an object assertion stayed green.

  The editor hand-rolled a three-pane layout, a toolbar and a breakpoint switcher. The shell supplies all of that as slots, so the editor passes its canvas, inspector, block library and device switcher into it rather than laying them out. The drag provider and its overlay are untouched: the shell owns no drag machinery and never looks inside the canvas slot.

  The shell no longer renders the document primary landmark. Its canvas region was a main element, and every mount sits inside a host that already has one, so a second gave assistive technology two competing primary landmarks. It is a named region now, which is also the more accurate description of an editor embedded in a page that owns its own primary content.

  Leaving the editor is optional. A host with nowhere to return to, such as the editor embedded as a field inside an entry form, gets no exit affordance at all rather than one that does nothing.

  The entry editor reported whether an author's work was stored visually only.
  `AutoSaveIndicator` cycles through "Saving…", "Saved", "Unsaved changes" and
  "Not saved", and the header carried no live region at all — so the control
  whose whole purpose is reassuring someone their work is safe did that for
  sighted users only.

  The header now has a single `role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"` region
  covering document status. One region rather than one per concern: two live
  regions in the same header interrupt each other, and a reader cannot tell which
  announcement belongs to what they just did.

  Two deliberate choices. The transient "saving" state is silent, because autosave
  debounces and announcing it speaks over the reader every few seconds while they
  type — what matters is where the state came to rest. And the spoken wording is a
  full sentence ("Your work is stored") rather than the chip's terse label, since
  an announcement arrives with no visual context to tell the listener what the
  word refers to.

  The region also accepts translation progress, so a multilingual entry can report
  both kinds of document state through the same channel.

  The entry editor described the same fact in three places: a language switcher
  in the header, per-language status pills in the document rail, and a
  completeness badge in the list. An author had to assemble "where am I, what
  state is everywhere else, and how far along is this document" from three
  fragments two panels apart.

  The pills now sit beside the switcher with a completeness bar and a written
  count, as one strip. The document rail keeps the ACTIONS on other languages
  (copy from another language, publish all) — those are document management
  rather than status.

  The count is derived once by `translationCounts` and read by both the bar and
  the header's spoken status region, so the two cannot drift. A language present
  in the entry's translation map but no longer configured is ignored rather than
  counted, which previously made "5 of 4" reachable.

  Nextly's admin is themeable because its surfaces read design tokens, and a surface that reaches past them keeps its light-mode appearance in dark mode. That contract was only enforced inside this repository, so the first-party plugins followed it and plugins built by anyone else had nothing checking them.

  The new package ships three rules — `no-palette-classes`, `no-hardcoded-colors` and `no-static-inline-style` — with a `recommended` config bundled in. Install it and extend `nextly.configs.recommended` to get the same checks the admin holds itself to, in your editor and in your CI. A genuine exception is marked in place with a `design-lint-ok: <reason>` comment rather than by disabling a rule.

  The repository's own design guard now derives which trees it scans instead of listing them, so a plugin package added later is covered automatically, and it reports what it read so a run that scanned nothing can no longer be mistaken for a clean one. The plugin template's settings page is rebuilt on design tokens, matching the guidance its own comment gives.

  The field-group builder drew its save-blocked notice as a hand-rolled tinted
  box: a 40%-alpha destructive border that composites to 1.69:1 over the page
  surface, against the 3:1 WCAG 1.4.11 asks of a component boundary. That single
  call site was the sole reason `packages/ui`'s contrast suite shipped red, so
  every lane touching `ui` inherited a failing test that was not theirs.

  It is now the shared `Alert`, whose destructive variant carries full-strength
  scale tokens and a solid left accent. The notice also gains `role="alert"`:
  `needsRepair` is derived from fetched data, so the refusal appears after the
  page settles and was previously announced to nobody.

  A field group is marked `diverged` when its tables changed and the record describing them did not, and it refuses every schema edit until that record is repaired. The repair existed but nothing could reach it. The Schema Builder now explains the block where it happens — on the field group being edited, which is where saving is refused — and the field group list offers the same repair on any row marked `diverged` or `failed`.

  The repair is previewed first. Reviewing it lists what would change by name rather than by count: fields whose columns are gone, attributes being brought back in line, and columns nobody declared, which are adopted under a type guessed from the physical column and are the ones worth correcting afterwards. Where the definition cannot be repaired without guessing — a column present on both tables, a physical type that no longer matches — each reason is reported individually and nothing is written. Approving a repair sends the version it was read against, so a plan reviewed in one tab can never be applied to a field group another tab has changed since. Previewing writes nothing and takes no lock, so it is safe to run at any time.

  The same operation is available as `GET` and `POST` on `/api/field-groups/schema/[slug]/reconcile` for callers driving it directly, and the result types are exported from `nextly/field-group-reconcile` for anyone rendering them.

  Note for anyone managing roles: saving in the Schema Builder requires `update-settings`. A role holding `create-settings` without it can open the builder and cannot save, which surfaces as saving being broken for one person rather than as a permission.

  `core/form`, `core/accordion` and `core/gallery` each declared
  `gap: { $token: "space.4" }`. A token reference compiles to
  `var(--site-space-4)`, and nothing in this repository ever emits that variable,
  so the declaration was invalid at computed-value time and `gap` fell back to
  `normal` — zero for a grid. Three blocks rendered with their children touching.

  Measured three ways that agree: `compileSiteSheet`, the only thing that turns a
  token set into CSS, has zero consumers outside `blocks-engine`;
  `emitTokenBlocks` is called only by that function, its own tests and a
  benchmark; and the string `--site-` appears in no source file outside the engine
  at all, against a positive control of `--nx-` appearing in four. So
  `defaultSiteTokens()` guarantees nothing today — it is a default nobody applies.

  Every existing check passed while this was broken: the property is in
  `STYLE_CATALOG`, and the declaration did reach the compiled stylesheet. Whether
  the `var()` inside the value RESOLVES is a third question, and nothing asked it.

  The blocks now use the length `space.4` itself declares, so the value does not
  change when this becomes a token again. `base-styles.test.tsx` gains the check
  that asks the third question, walking to the leaf so a token nested inside an
  object-shaped declaration is caught too, with a positive control for both
  shapes. It is a ratchet with an expiry: when the site stylesheet is wired into
  the render path it should be deleted by the change that wires it, rather than
  weakened or exempted per block.

  (`FormLayout`, `FormActions`, `FieldShell`, `Grid`) from `@nextlyhq/ui`.

  The view no longer hand-rolls its own card, page padding or a negative-margin
  hack to escape that padding; `FormLayout` owns the measure. The submit and
  cancel actions moved into one `FormActions` bar at the end of the page, fed the
  form state's existing dirty flag instead of a second, separately-rendered
  unsaved-changes indicator. The Settings and Notifications tabs no longer cap
  their own width, so they fill the page measure instead of sitting narrower
  than it. The Notifications sheet's two-column rows moved off a viewport
  breakpoint onto `Grid`'s container-query mode, since the admin content region
  is narrower than the window whenever both sidebars are open.

  Simple single-element fields (plain text/email inputs) now render through
  `FieldShell` for their label, description and error wiring.

  `FieldShell`'s `children` now also accepts a function —
  `(field: FieldShellRenderProps) => ReactNode`, `FieldShellRenderProps` newly
  exported — receiving the `{ id, describedBy, invalid }` it computes so a
  caller can apply that wiring to a nested element instead of relying on a
  single top-level `cloneElement`. This is what a compound Radix control needs:
  `Select`'s root destructures a fixed prop list and never forwards the rest,
  so an id cloned onto it never reaches the real, focusable `SelectTrigger` two
  levels down — silently, with no error and no warning. Both call paths derive
  their id/`aria-describedby`/`aria-invalid` from one shared computation, so
  they cannot drift into disagreeing about the same field. In development,
  `FieldShell` now also checks after mount whether the id it computed landed on
  any element in the document at all, and warns once, by field name, if it did
  not — the general form of the defect a compound control's dropped id was a
  specific case of. Every `Select`-driven field in the form builder's Create/
  Edit view and its Notifications sheet (Status, Email provider, Email
  template, Send-to type, Recipient address in field mode, Reply-To mode,
  Reply-To visitor-field in field mode, and the send-condition Field and
  Comparison pickers) now goes through `FieldShell` using this render-function
  form, wiring their `SelectTrigger` correctly for the first time. `RadioGroup`,
  `AddressChipList` and the horizontal label-left/control-right rows
  (`SettingRow`, the Enabled toggle) stay hand-rolled for their own, unrelated
  reasons, each documented at its own call site.

  `FormControl` named the description element in `aria-describedby`
  unconditionally, while `FormDescription` renders nothing when it has no
  children. Every field without a description therefore pointed assistive
  technology at an element that was never on the page: the admin has 76
  `FormControl` usages against 3 `FormDescription`, and 13 of the 14 files using
  `FormControl` contain no description at all.

  `FormDescription` now registers its presence on the field context and
  `FormControl` composes `aria-describedby` from the elements that actually
  render. Measured in a browser across eight admin form routes in both themes:
  five dangling references before, zero after.

The panel was built on a
  modal surface, so it dimmed the page behind a scrim, trapped focus inside itself and withdrew
  everything else from the accessibility tree — leaving the one thing an editor needs beside a
  version, the document itself, unreachable and unscrollable. It is now a non-modal panel: the page
  stays lit, scrollable and focusable while history is open, and the panel closes from its own
  controls or Escape rather than from any click into the page.

  The Sheet primitive gains the same capability for every caller. Its root already accepted Radix's
  modal flag; the scrim is now derived from that one value rather than decided separately by the
  content, so a non-modal sheet cannot paint a scrim over a page it deliberately left interactive.
  Existing sheets are unchanged, because modal remains the default.

  symlinks no longer writes a pointer that loops.

  A relative include resolves from the directory it was written in, so one file
  reached through two aliases in different directories points at two different
  targets. The scaffolder now identifies a visited file by that pair rather than by
  the file alone, so an alias whose includes lead somewhere new is followed instead
  of skipped.

Loading and failure are part of it: a list that is still
  loading, or that failed to load, keeps its search field and controls in place instead of
  replacing the whole page with a message. The search box no longer disappears from under you the
  moment you type, and the page no longer jumps when results arrive.

  Email providers keeps its type filter visible in the toolbar rather than behind a dropdown, so
  you can see what the list is filtered to without opening anything.

  control and the spacing above the table match every other list in the admin.

  Their empty states are part of that now. Each page carried its own, and each drew the same
  distinction by hand — one message when the list is genuinely empty, with a button to create the
  first record, and a different one when a search or filter simply matched nothing. That rule now
  lives in one place, so no list can drift into offering "create your first" to someone whose
  search just came up short. The empty state also reads as a heading to a screen reader, which it
  did not before.

  When a collections or field-groups list fails to load, the page now reports it the way every
  other list reports a failure, instead of showing a separate warning above a table that is still
  drawn.

It renamed a stored field's `type` to a spelling no runtime code reads, so a migrated database held definitions the application refused at boot. Table, column and registry renames are unchanged, and a database migrated by an earlier build is repaired by rolling back and re-running.

  Field groups were called components once, and the old vocabulary is still in the database: the registry table, each field group's data table, and the column naming which field group a stored row belongs to. Nextly reads whichever generation a database holds, so nothing forces this — a site that never runs it keeps working. This is the command for tidying it up, one site at a time.

  Running it with no flags writes nothing and prints the plan. Applying is `--apply`, which requires `--backup-confirmed` alongside it, and `--down` rolls a completed migration back. A preview takes no lock and issues no DDL, so it can be run with a read-only credential.

  The preview reports three things separately, because they answer different questions: every storage object that would be renamed, listed by name rather than counted; whether the plan was checked against your database or merely proposed, since another run writing at the same time makes the list an upper bound; and what could be seen of the migration lock, where "nothing is running" and "the lock could not be read" are reported as the different answers they are.

  A new guide, Field group storage migration, covers the per-site runbook, how to read the preview, and rollback.

  The command installed no table resolver, so the migration failed at its first system-table read with "Table \"dynamic_collections\" not found in schema registry" — on every database. Previewing was unaffected, which is why it was not caught: a preview stops before the writes that resolve tables, so the command previewed correctly and then failed on the first real run.

  Both spellings of the field-group registry are now registered, because this is the one operation that runs while that name is changing.

  `PageRenderer` gains `nodeAttribute`, OFF by default. Turned on, each block's
  root carries `data-nx-node="<node id>"` — the only per-node hook that reaches the
  DOM independently of styling.

  The scoped class cannot serve: `classNameFor` returns the block-TYPE class alone
  for a node with no compiled styles, so hit-testing on the class cannot address an
  unstyled node and would resolve to the wrong instance. Most nodes on a real page
  are unstyled.

  The attribute is applied ABOVE `withNodeAttributes`' early return rather than
  joined to its allowlist loop, because that return fires for any node with no
  `cssId` and no `attributes` — nearly every node — so an address on the loop would
  have landed on almost nothing while a fixture setting either field passed.

  Off by default because a published page should not carry editor concerns, which
  is why Gutenberg's `data-block` is editor-only. Opt-in is also reversible;
  always-on would be a breaking change to remove.

  `NODE_ID_ATTRIBUTE` is published so an editor never hard-codes the spelling.

  `tsBuildInfoFile` was declared as a plain relative path in the shared base
  config, and a relative path there resolves against the file that declares it —
  not against the config extending it. Every package in the workspace therefore
  wrote its TypeScript incremental state to one shared file inside
  `packages/tsconfig`, each `tsc` run overwriting the last, so the state a package
  read back always described a different program. Turbo runs these in parallel,
  so they also raced to write it.

  The same path put the file outside every package's own directory, so turbo's
  package-scoped `outputs` matched nothing and 21 packages logged
  `no output files found for task <pkg>#check-types` on every run.

  `${configDir}` resolves to the directory of the extending config, which is what
  was meant. Removing the option instead is not available: tsup's dts step drives
  tsc through flags rather than a config file, where `--incremental` without an
  explicit `--tsBuildInfoFile` is TS5074 and fails the build.

  A collection declares its preview two ways and they are disjoint: code-first writes a function of the entry, a UI-created collection writes a template string. Both are now answered by one resolver, so the admin asks where an entry previews instead of deciding for itself.

  Resolving on the server is what makes the preview button reachable for editors and authors. The site URL sits behind a settings permission neither role holds, so a browser-side answer was unavailable to exactly the people who share previews.

The toolbar was

  `createBlocksPage` gains `siteStyles` and supplies a sheet by DEFAULT, unlike the
  bare `PageRenderer`. Without one, every `{ $token }` resolves to nothing — and a
  framework route is exactly where "it should already work" is the right answer.
  `PageRenderer` stays opt-in because a standalone consumer owns its own `<head>`
  and may already emit a token sheet; a Nextly route owns neither.

  Default-on was licensed by measurement rather than assumed safe: no block
  declares a token (enforced by a ratchet over every `baseStyles`) and no seeded or
  fixture document references one, so nothing's appearance can change by the
  definitions arriving.

  `breakpoints` falls back to `styleContext`'s, derived once — two answers to "what
  are this site's breakpoints" is how the shared sheet and the page sheet come to
  disagree about which at-rules a tier compiles under, invisibly, because each
  sheet is internally consistent on its own.

  The root entry now re-exports `SiteSheetInput` and its transitive closure
  (`SiteTokenSet`, `SiteToken`, `TokenKind`, `FontFaceDef`, `FontSource`,
  `DarkModeStrategy`), so a consumer can construct a site's design system rather
  than merely name the prop.

  The admin sidebar previously decided which navigation icon was active by matching the URL against a list of paths, falling back to Dashboard when none matched. A route missing from that list did not fail — it quietly highlighted Dashboard, which looks identical to a page that really is Dashboard. That is how a top-level admin route shipped highlighting the wrong entry, unnoticed.

  Each route now states its own section, and the type system requires it: a new admin route that does not say where it belongs fails to build instead of appearing in the wrong place.

  For plugin authors, admin pages and menu items accept an optional `section`, so a plugin is no longer confined to the Plugins area. Omitting it defers to the plugin's own placement, so a plugin that already declares where it lives does not repeat itself for every page, and `"standalone"` reuses the top-level entry and icon such a plugin already gets for its collections.

  points at it, following the pattern the monorepo uses for itself.

  The guide is written for a coding agent picking the project up cold: where the
  config and collections live, which commands exist, and the things that surprise
  people — that `find()` is loosely typed until `types:generate` runs, that users
  are read through their own namespace rather than as a collection, and that a
  migration you generate is a single file in this project's own dialect, while a
  suffixed set beside it means that migration was shipped rather than generated.

  The generated content sits inside a managed block, so a future regeneration can
  replace it without touching notes written above or below it.

  `SettingsRow` emits a `<label for>` for every row, while whether anything claims
  that id depends entirely on what the caller passes as children. The email
  provider's secret field wrapped its control in a positioning `<div>` inside
  `FormControl`, which is a Radix `Slot` and clones onto its single child — so the
  id, `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid` all landed on the div. A label cannot
  name a div, so the API key and SMTP password fields had no accessible name and
  their validation errors were never announced, while the id still resolved.

  `FormControl` now sits on the input itself, and a development-time check reports
  both ways a label can fail to reach a control: an id nothing carries, and an id
  carried by an element a label cannot name. The mechanism is shared with the
  entry-form fields, which previously carried a presence-only copy that could not
  see the second case.

Embedded as a field inside a form on a wide screen, it used to conclude it had room and squeeze the rail, panel and canvas below the widths they need; it now says it needs more width in that case, and goes back to the full layout as soon as the space grows again.

  The media picker also no longer floats over that message. It opens in a layer outside the editor, so hiding the editor left an open picker visible and clickable on top of the notice saying the editor was unavailable.

  Singles get the same recovery points the entry editor already had: recorded
  while the author types, offered back on open, and reported in the header beside

  `PageRenderer` was opt-in while a Nextly route emitted by default, and the
  asymmetry cost more than it saved: a block could not reference a token at all,
  because a default reading `color.surface` resolved on a route and silently
  resolved to nothing in a standalone render. `core/card` shipped with no
  background and no border for that reason, and the pressure that produced six
  blocks reaching for the admin `--nx-*` namespace stayed exactly where it was.

  Both paths now emit, and a host opts out with `siteStyles={false}` — an explicit
  refusal rather than an empty token list, because `resolveSiteTokens` LAYERS, so
  an empty override means "no overrides" and still yields every default. A test is
  what found that the opt-out did not exist at all.

  Breakpoints come from the RECONCILED compile context rather than the caller's
  `styleContext`, so a consumer rendering a stored artifact — the ordinary
  production path — gets a sheet instead of nothing.

  `PageRenderer` gains an opt-in `siteStyles` prop that compiles the shared sheet
  and emits it BEFORE the page's own, and `blocks-engine` gains
  `resolveSiteTokens`, which layers a site's own tokens over the defaults by name.

  Until now nothing in the repository called `compileSiteSheet`. The token
  pipeline was built, tested and unreachable: `defaultSiteTokens()` was a default
  nobody applied, and every `{ $token }` compiled to a `var()` with nothing behind
  it. Three shipped blocks were broken by that and nothing reported it, because an
  unresolved custom property makes the declaration invalid at computed-value time
  and the property silently falls back to its initial value.

  Order is the cascade: font faces, tokens and block-type defaults first, the
  page's own sheet after, which is what lets a node's own value beat a class and a
  class beat a block default.

  Layering rather than replacing means a site supplying one brand colour does not
  thereby lose `content.width` and `space.4`. This is the arrangement Gutenberg's
  `theme.json` reaches — core defaults, then the theme's file, then the user's
  saved styles — and a stored per-site override layers the same way, so the third
  tier needs no new mechanism.

  Opt-in rather than automatic: emitting token definitions unasked changes what a
  stored token reference resolves to, and a page whose current appearance depends
  on one dangling is a page that moves.

  The guaranteed set had no surface colour and no border colour, and their absence
  made four blocks compromise: `core/card` shipped with no background and no
  border, `badge` was unbuildable because a tinted background IS the block, the
  accordion had no divider and the table no border colour.

  It also created a defect class. Because nothing in the set could express a
  surface, six blocks across three lanes independently reached for `--nx-*` — the
  ADMIN namespace, which no published page emits, so those rules validated,
  compiled, shipped and resolved to nothing. That is design pressure rather than
  six mistakes: when the correct mechanism is missing, whatever resembles it gets
  used.

  All three define both light and dark values, and a test now requires that of
  every colour token rather than only the new ones — a colour defined only for
  light silently keeps its light value on a dark page. `color.muted` was chosen to
  clear WCAG AA against `color.background` in both modes rather than by eye,
  because a muted token that fails contrast is worse than none: it reads as
  sanctioned.

  One border colour rather than a subtle/strong scale. A scale is much harder to
  remove from a guaranteed set than to add to one, and no block has asked for the
  distinction; a site wanting more defines its own, and `resolveSiteTokens` layers
  additions by name.

  the 480px history panel. A diff is a two-column reading by nature, and that panel could not hold
  two columns, so the comparison was written to stack; each field now states its before and after
  side by side under headings naming the two versions, and folds back into a stack only where the
  surface is genuinely too narrow for two. A field that exists on one side only says so on the
  other, rather than leaving a blank that reads the same as an empty value. The history panel keeps
  its list and preview and no longer swaps its body out to compare.

Previewing one used to go through a viewer
  written only for version history, which had its own idea of how each field type looked and knew
  nothing about tabs, rows or collapsible sections — so a version was legible but never quite the
  page it came from. It is drawn by the editor's own field components now, read-only, which means
  layout survives, every field type presents exactly as it does when editing, and a field type added
  in future is supported in history the day it renders in the editor.

  The snapshot is rendered against its own form rather than loaded into the live one. Nothing an
  editor has typed is disturbed by opening a version, and no historical value can reach a save or an
  autosave, because those values never enter the form that either of them reads.

- [#978](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/978) [`4fb19fe`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/4fb19feb500e33941ab32fd0f7e4ae2cb29b36a0) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Two defects in how a past version renders, both found in review.

  Selecting a second version while the panel stayed open left the previous version's values on screen
  under the new version's heading. The form read its values once when it mounted, and the panel does
  not remount it between selections; it now follows a changed snapshot itself, so the correct
  behaviour belongs to the component rather than to every caller remembering to remount it.

  Structured fields could render empty for a version that plainly held something. A snapshot is
  captured from the persisted row, so a JSON-backed field arrives as text on SQLite and as an object
  on Postgres and MySQL, and a boolean arrives in any of four spellings. Those values are now read
  into runtime shapes before the editor sees them, through the same coercion the diff and the value
  kit already use.

- [#894](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/894) [`05fa889`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/05fa88981d5df7dcb5cb6a77dee4046f4d5039e5) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - feat(nextly): add a concurrency token to the autosave compare-and-set

  The rolling autosave row is rewritten in place, guarded by a compare-and-set so
  that two tabs belonging to one author cannot overwrite each other. That guard
  compared `updated_at` against the value the write had observed, and the stored
  resolution of a timestamp differs per dialect: SQLite keeps whole epoch seconds
  and MySQL milliseconds. Two rewrites close enough together serialize
  identically, so the second writer observes exactly what the first wrote, its
  predicate matches, and it overwrites newer work believing the row untouched.

  `nextly_versions` gains a monotonic `revision` counter. The compare-and-set
  reads it, applies only while the row still holds it, and writes its successor.
  A counter has no resolution to exhaust, so the guard holds however close
  together two writes fall.

  The column is additive and carries a default, so `nextly migrate` adds it to
  databases that already exist rather than refusing the migration.

  `no-palette-classes` missed a fixed palette colour placed behind an arbitrary Tailwind variant — `data-[state=open]:bg-red-500`, `supports-[display:grid]:bg-red-500` and the bracket-led `[&>*]:bg-red-500` all reported clean, so a colour that ignores dark mode and retheming passed lint.

  `no-hardcoded-colors` rejected the four-digit spelling of the mode-invariant colours it documents as legitimate: `#0000` and `#fff8` were reported as hardcoded, because alpha was only offered on the six-digit forms.

### Patch Changes

- [#720](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/720) [`8a7e734`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/8a7e734cce5d8948b779d28ff875a41c63e0071a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Take the reference palette's light-mode values for the admin, and record what
  that costs where a reader will find it.

  `--nx-input`, `--nx-border-strong` and `--nx-sidebar-border` move to the
  reference border weight; `--nx-destructive` and `--nx-destructive-solid` move to
  the reference red; `--nx-sidebar-foreground` matches the active nav ink so the
  sidebar reads at body-text weight.

  Several of those render below their WCAG minimum, deliberately. Each affected
  pairing is listed in the new `contrast/accepted.ts` with the ratio it actually
  measures, and the contrast suites hold every entry to three properties: it still
  measures what is recorded, it is still below its threshold, and it still names a
  token the theme declares. The sharpest is white on the destructive fill at
  3.84:1, which is the label of the Delete, Discard and Unpublish confirm buttons.

  Because resting and active sidebar ink are now one value in light mode, the
  active row also carries a font-weight change. A fill at 1.11:1 cannot identify a
  state on its own, and a weight difference is not a colour, so it is not subject
  to a contrast ratio at all.

  Dark mode is unchanged apart from `--nx-success`, which moves a step lighter to
  clear its minimum on the muted surface with the margin the suite requires.

  Checkbox and radio take a new `--nx-control-border` rather than following the
  field border down. A field is identifiable without its edge; an unchecked box is
  only the box, so its boundary is held to 3:1 with no acceptance.

- [#830](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/830) [`f53dbd8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/f53dbd82ffa339c278630b12c7d812fbf4ea0ba3) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Give every admin list one owner for its page state, and one source for its page-size policy.

  Twelve list surfaces each held the same two `useState` calls plus their own `handlePageSizeChange` wrapper that set the size and then reset the page. They now use the existing `usePagination` hook, which owns those resets. That removes the drift risk across the copies and, more usefully, removes the wrapper entirely: `onPageSizeChange` is the hook's `setPageSize`, which resets the page in the same update, so a query keyed on both refetches once rather than twice.

  The page-size options were a literal `[10, 25, 50]` written out at nine call sites. They are now `PAGINATION.TABLE_PAGE_SIZE_OPTIONS`, beside the existing page-size constants, so the policy can change in one place. The two lists that deliberately differ keep their own: the media grid offers 12/24/48/96 because it lays out thumbnails, and the delivery log offers 20/50/100 because it is read in long scans. `usePagination`'s own defaults now derive from those constants rather than restating 0 and 10.

  `Pagination`'s `pageSizeOptions` is typed `readonly number[]`, since the component only maps over it and a mutable type would reject the shared options for no reason a caller could act on.

  Two lists stay off the hook and say why where they declare their state. The entries list is 1-indexed because that is what its API takes, and converting at every read and write trades one clear boundary for a class of off-by-one. The relationship picker accumulates results rather than paginating them: its page number only increments, results append, and there is no way back to a previous page.

- [#783](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/783) [`376a3a4`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/376a3a49a0a5d0a13a85c546cebd08444a9443ed) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Repair the blog template so a scaffolded project type-checks and builds.

  A new blog project failed its build at the search-index step: it has no posts,
  so Pagefind indexed nothing and exited non-zero. The empty case is now reported
  and skipped, while a real Pagefind failure still stops the build.

  SQL statement splitting no longer tracks string state through comment text. An
  apostrophe in a retained comment opened a string that never closed, which merged
  every following statement into one that SQLite rejects.

  The query layer narrows documents with runtime-checked readers instead of
  asserting them to its domain types, and a collection can declare defaultColumns
  in code as the admin and the visual schema already allowed. That option is now
  also carried through collection sync, which previously rebuilt the persisted
  admin shape in two places and dropped it in both.

  Type change worth reading before upgrading: `FindUsersArgs` no longer inherits
  the `FindArgs` options that `users.find()` does not implement — `where`,
  `status`, `sort`, `select`, `populate` and `pagination`. Passing them compiled
  and did nothing, so a `where` clause intended as an exact lookup returned the
  first arbitrary user; code that passes one will now fail to compile. Use
  `search`, or read a page and compare the field directly.

- [#785](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/785) [`8dc013e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/8dc013efe16d092c852fdd84db548f755a53fbee) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Refuse to start when boot migrations did not run. With `db.runMigrationsOnBoot`,
  an instance that could not take the migrate lock before its wait deadline used
  to log `Boot migrations complete (0 applied)` and serve traffic — `applied` is 0
  there and 0 on an up-to-date database, so nothing distinguished them. On a
  rolling deploy that is the second replica serving against a schema it never
  migrated. It now fails startup, which an orchestrator retries once the other
  instance finishes; a genuinely stale lock is cleared with
  `nextly migrate --force-unlock`.

  `withMigrateLock` reports whether its body ran instead of returning `undefined`
  for both "returned nothing" and "never ran", so every caller has to decide. Its
  wait-timeout message said "proceeding without it" while returning without
  running the migrations, and now says they were skipped.

  keyboard surface and the host keeps its own vocabulary.

  `tsup --watch` defaults to watching `.`, and at that root it never notices an
  edit: no `Change detected`, no rebuild, and an artifact byte-identical
  afterwards. Measured back to back on tsup 8.5.0 — `--watch .` saw nothing,
  `--watch src` detected the same edit and rebuilt it.

  Nothing errored while it was broken, which is why it survived: the watcher logs
  a successful initial build and then `Watching for changes`, and the only symptom
  is the ABSENCE of a later build line in output that scrolls. Anyone debugging a
  stale `dist` was debugging code that had never been rebuilt.

- [#733](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/733) [`24a3a4d`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/24a3a4d8a145cf28d86ad8f4adaed1a01e886704) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - add the page-builder editor shell

  `@nextlyhq/builder` gains `BuilderShell` — the editor frame: an icon rail, one
  switched left panel, the canvas slot, a fixed right inspector, and the bars
  around them. Presentational by contract: it owns which panel is open and the
  region widths, and owns nothing about the document, so selection arrives as a
  prop.

  Also exported: the shell's own decisions (`LEFT_PANELS`, `PANEL_BOUNDS`,
  `RAIL_WIDTH`, `MIN_SHELL_WIDTH`, `MIN_CANVAS_WIDTH`) and the `PreferenceStore`
  port a host implements to keep chrome preferences wherever it already keeps
  preferences.

  New subpath `@nextlyhq/builder/styles.css` carries the `--nx-builder-*` chrome
  token layer. A consumer that renders the shell without importing it gets
  unstyled markup.

- [#682](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/682) [`7b19d8a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/7b19d8a32ef93fa0fca34a04e0fa245e35f83f67) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Add the op store's vocabulary and inverse derivation to the builder: every document change is one of four id-addressed ops, and the op that undoes it is derived from the state it was applied to rather than declared by the caller.

- [#831](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/831) [`7a23525`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/7a2352598add92995fd8f3314a1eced3f87cef5d) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Rank every canvas drop target on one collision scale, so which target claims the pointer no longer depends on how deeply the page nests.

- [#813](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/813) [`a6555f8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/a6555f87b80d7f454de94a69ed850c773a279567) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Stop the page-builder canvas reflowing when a drag starts. Drop zones no longer grow from zero to six pixels on dragstart, so blocks stay where they are while you aim, and the insertion bar now paints above blocks that carry a stacking context of their own.

- [#781](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/781) [`cec9cc3`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/cec9cc391639f1632882d7f5af0c5d9f5d989145) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Updating a field group now changes its table wherever the update comes from. The mounted PATCH route and the Direct API previously stored the new fields without moving the physical schema, so only the admin panel performed the whole operation. A companion-table transition that fails now refuses the update instead of recording it as done, and the Direct API can toggle a field group localized.

- [#795](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/795) [`faf7fd7`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/faf7fd704e2625cf9c2ca1156fbe02c73f270e53) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Add `core/column` as a real block and restrict `core/columns` to accept only columns, so a column can carry its own width, background and alignment.

  A block whose slot refuses it is now reported by the repair banner and repaired by WRAPPING it in the one type the slot admits, so a page stored with loose children in a columns row can be fixed without discarding them. The block library's Insert button applies the same drop rules a drag does, inserting into the nearest place that accepts the block and reporting when there is nowhere. Slots declare whether they lay their children out with flex or grid, so the canvas stops interleaving drop zones that would become cells of that layout.

  A block can declare the parents it may sit under — `parent`, matching the field of the same name in Gutenberg's block metadata — enforced on the editor and the write path alike, with the repair banner offering to wrap a stray block in the parent it names. This is the half a slot's `allow` list cannot express: a slot naming a type must not confine that type to it, and a block that is meaningless outside one parent has to say so itself.

  It is declared on `@nextlyhq/blocks-engine`'s `BlockDefinition`, so it reaches plugin authors through `@nextlyhq/plugin-sdk/blocks` alongside every other block field. A contributed block's nesting rules are enforced wherever the engine registry is populated — the write validator, the repair finder and the node constructor resolve a block's slots and permitted parents through it when this package's own registry does not hold the block. **Not yet in the browser editor:** blocks are registered by a plugin's server-side `init`, and the admin's client config transports only `remotePatterns`, so the browser realm's registry is empty and the canvas applies no contributed rule. Enforcement therefore holds at SAVE and not during editing, which is the safe direction — a document the editor let you build is still refused rather than stored — and it is a gap rather than a design. Slot allow-lists honour the engine's namespace wildcard (`core/*`) wherever they are read, rather than only exact names.

  `core/column` uses `parent` so inserting a Column while one is selected produces a sibling in the row rather than a column nested inside a column.

  `blocks.manifest.json` carries `parent`, and its `manifestVersion` moves to **2**. That artifact is read by editor builds and by agents to decide where a block may legally sit, so omitting the field would not have made the restriction lenient — it would have told every reader there was none, and they would generate placements the write validator then refuses. The bump is required rather than cautious: the entry schema is strict, so a v1 reader rejects an entry carrying the new field outright.

  The block library's Insert button now reaches a container's NAMED slot, not only `default`, so a container the drag path accepts is no longer refused by the click path. Documents are migrated when the editor loads them, which is what makes any block's `migrate` reachable at all — and migration only ever moves a document forward, never stamping an older definition version onto data written by a newer one.

  The slot rules are now enforced in the editor's reducer, so paste, keyboard reorder and anything added later cannot write a document the save path refuses — previously only drag-and-drop consulted them. Documents are migrated when the editor loads them, which is what makes any block's `migrate` reachable at all.

  Every drop target on the canvas now ranks by its depth in the tree, rather than only the zones between children doing so. A droppable that names no collision priority keeps the one its detector assigned — 3 with the pointer inside it, 2 otherwise — and dnd-kit compares priority before collision type and before overlap, so those targets outranked every zone shallower than that constant however the rectangles lay. The insert-before and append targets carried on each block were in that state, which put a nested container's own append target at or below the zones of the container holding it. They now read the same depth the zones do, so nesting decides which container claims a drop and geometry decides only where depths tie.

  Fixes a crash opening an Image's aspect-ratio control: Radix refuses a select item whose value is the empty string.

It was created on demand and declared nowhere, so it sat outside every migration: a change to that table could never reach an installation that already had one, because the statement that creates it does nothing to a table that exists. Nothing about the lock behaves differently today; what changes is that it can be maintained at all.

  granted whatever the plugin's enabled state, so withholding them made the page

- [#751](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/751) [`e344e47`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/e344e47aca0aef1df894d52b06d9c985568bf390) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The email delivery log is now bounded, and an erasure request survives a
  secret rotation.

  The log records who was written to, identified by a digest of their address,
  and it grew on every send with nothing to remove it. The column that was meant
  to govern it and the index beside it were written and never read, so an
  operator reading a labelled retention class would reasonably have concluded
  something enforced it.

  A sweep now removes rows past their window. It is offered by the SEND path
  rather than by a content write, because rows here are created by sends: that is
  when the table grows, a content write has no relationship to email volume, and
  an install that never sends mail carries no pass at all. Omitting the setting
  keeps a default window rather than keeping rows forever, since an unbounded
  record of recipients is not a reasonable default for a table an install fills
  without opting in.

  This is the second half of erasure, and the halves cover different people.
  Erasing a named recipient only reaches someone a caller can name, and many
  recipients never had an account. The sweep reaches every row by age, whoever it
  belonged to.

  Erasure also reached only rows hashed with the CURRENT secret. Rotating it left
  older rows carrying a value the request no longer computed, so it matched
  nothing and reported success — a privacy request that silently under-delivers.
  Retired secrets can now be listed in \`NEXTLY_SECRET_PREVIOUS\`, kept for reading
  and never for writing, and an erasure matches every digest those generations
  could have produced. It accepts a comma-separated list for the ordinary case and
  a JSON array for the secrets a comma-separated list cannot express — one holding
  a comma or significant whitespace, \`null\` for a generation that was unkeyed, and
  \`""\` for a secret that really was empty. Documented under "Rotating
  \`NEXTLY_SECRET\`" in the environment reference.

  Two things are deliberately unchanged. A send already in flight when a deletion
  commits still records its row; closing that would mean keeping a list of the
  addresses that asked to be forgotten, and the sweep bounds the row instead. And
  the retry columns stay inert: nothing drains this table, and a queue nobody

A field-group update whose registry write fails after its companion table already changed is recorded with a new `diverged` migration status and reported as a change that stands, rather than raised as though nothing had happened. `diverged` is deliberately distinct from `failed`: `failed` means the table was never created and retrying is the repair, while `diverged` means the tables hold the new shape and the stored definition holds the old one, so the field group must be reconciled and the edit must NOT be retried. A diverged field group is refused for further schema edits until it is reconciled.

- [#745](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/745) [`4c8d39c`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/4c8d39c312db0feb8093f14751655779ce27793a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Retention no longer reads a sub-millisecond window as a request to delete everything.

  A retention window is a whole number of milliseconds, so a fractional value is
  rounded down. That rounding ran AFTER the check for zero, which meant any window
  under one millisecond arrived as a window rather than as the zero it becomes:
  \`0.5\` was not zero when the check ran, and was zero by the time it was used.

  On the audit trails a window of zero is treated as a mistake and replaced by the
  default, because erasing the record of who did what on a typo is not
  recoverable. That protection was reachable only by writing exactly zero. A value
  that rounded to zero skipped it and produced a cutoff of the current moment,
  which removes the entire trail on the next pass.

  The rounding now happens before the reading, so a window is judged as the value
  it actually resolves to. A delivery ledger set to a fraction still keeps
  nothing, which is that trail's own position on zero and unchanged.

  A date input paints its own `dd/mm/yyyy` format hint and ignores `placeholder` outright, so a range written that way drew two identical empty boxes with nothing saying which end was which. The same spelling renders correctly on text and number inputs, which is why it survived: the defect is specific to one input type and invisible in the source.

  Both date ranges in the admin -- the condition row and the entries filter menu -- now use one `RangeField` with real `<label>` elements bound to their inputs, and the pair is exposed as a named group. The filter menu had no accessible name on either input at all.

  A pager's placement depends on whether the row table or the mobile card view is showing, and `DataTableView` is the only component that knows: the pager sits inside the card on desktop and takes the column's gap on mobile. Every list used to build the pager markup itself and hand it over, which left that decision at the call site — where the wrong arrangement is the one you get by writing the markup in reading order, and where several surfaces had drifted into it.

  Tables now pass `pagination` as data: `currentPage`, `pageSize`, `onPageChange` and the rest, typed as the pager's own props rather than a restatement of them. A caller supplying state has no opportunity to place the control, so the mistake is no longer available to make. API keys, deliveries, webhooks, collections, field groups, singles, roles, users, plugins, email providers, email templates, image sizes, entries and the media list view are all on it, and `MediaListView` forwards the prop rather than a node.

  Two surfaces keep rendering a pager directly, and say why where they render it: the media grid, which has no row-versus-card view to place one for, and the user-fields list, whose drag-reorderable rows are drawn by a DndContext over a plain table rather than by `DataTableView`.

  Two fixes found along the way. Choosing a larger page size on the image sizes list left the page number pointing past the end, showing the empty message over a list that had rows. And the media library's two pagers now carry distinct accessible labels rather than both announcing themselves as "Pagination".

A run renews its claim while it works, so a run that crashes or is killed no longer leaves a lock only an operator can clear, while a run that is still working keeps the lock for as long as it needs it.

  `size="sm"` resolved to `--nx-control-height-md` (36px) on `Button` and `--nx-control-height-sm` (32px) on `Input` and `SelectTrigger`, so a small button beside a small input or select sat 4px out of line. `default` and `lg` already agreed; only `sm` diverged.

  Input and select now take the same step as button. Nothing changes visually today: there was not one `<Input size="sm">` or `<SelectTrigger size="sm">` anywhere in the repository, which is why the divergence survived — it was waiting for its first call site rather than showing up on a screen. Aligning the other direction would have shrunk sixty live buttons to fix a case nobody had hit yet.

  A test now calls the exported `cva` functions and asserts that every size name shared by these primitives resolves to the same height token, and that the steps stay ordered. It reads the class string a caller actually receives rather than parsing the variant maps out of the source.

  The admin sidebar's search field asked for `h-9` directly, which happened to equal the small step and then stopped tracking it. It takes `size="sm"` now, and its icon is centred rather than offset by a fixed `top-2.5` that only centred inside a 36px control — the same height decision written a second time.

  Which routes are reachable without a session was answered in three places: the
  page registry, a hand-kept set in the refresh interceptor, and the
  `pages/(auth)/` directory. A page added to the registry but missed in the
  interceptor still rendered, but its expected 401 redirected to login and
  discarded the URL, which is how an invite token was once lost.

  `PUBLIC_ROUTE_PATHS` in `constants/routes.ts` is now the declaration. The
  registry keys its public pages by that type, so the two cannot disagree without
  failing the build, and the interceptor derives its set from the same array. A
  test reads the `(auth)` directory, which no type can reach, and fails on a page
  nobody declared. No behaviour changes.

  Setting a retention window to `Infinity` — the strongest way the type allows you
  to say "keep these forever" — was deleting instead. Audit trails were removed
  after 90 days and webhook events after 30, on the schedule the default sets,
  while the setting itself read as accepted. Nothing surfaced it: the pass ran,
  reported success, and pruned rows the configuration had asked to retain.

  The cause was two separate answers to one question. Audit and webhook retention
  each resolved a configured window in their own file, and the two had drifted: a
  2000-year window kept everything, an infinite one deleted, and the same input
  produced different outcomes depending on which trail it was written for. Webhook
  retention also had no upper bound at all, so a very large window produced a
  cutoff date no database column can store, which made the pass fail silently on
  every run and leave the ledger unpruned.

  There is now one resolver behind both, built on the rule they disagreed about:
  refusing a value must never delete more than accepting it would. An infinite
  window, and any window longer than a date can express, now mean keep forever.
  Values that ask for less than the default, or for nothing coherent, still fall
  back to the default, because that direction cannot lose data.

  How long a window a trail can express is stated by the trail rather than shared,
  because it is set by the column the cutoff is compared against and those differ.
  Content activity is compared against a column counting from 1970 and so tops out
  around fifty years; the audit, event and delivery trails count from a calendar
  year and accept far longer windows. Sharing one ceiling would have meant a
  window a column can hold being answered with "never prune", which is unbounded
  growth on a setting that asked for the opposite.

  Two positions each trail holds on its own are unchanged: `false` still means
  keep forever everywhere, and a delivery ledger set to zero still keeps nothing,
  which is a real choice for a table whose only purpose is making a retry
  possible.

  them.

  The permission list endpoint now forwards `includeOrphaned`, so a caller that
  reports what a plugin owns can ask for rows nothing declares any more. They are
  shown marked rather than hidden: the row still exists and still carries its
  grants, so leaving it out understated what a plugin left behind. Lists that
  OFFER permissions are unchanged, because the option is off unless asked for, so
  the role permission matrix still shows only permissions that enforce something.

  order and sidebarGroup were accepted by CollectionAdminOptions and dropped by the
  projection that writes the registry, so a code-first collection could set its
  sidebar position, type-check, and still sort by the default. admin.description
  had no column under admin at all; it now resolves to the collection's own
  description, which is the field the admin already renders and the Schema Builder
  already edits.

  A compile-time assertion now requires every admin option to be either persisted
  or listed with the reason it is not, so adding one forces the author to classify
  it in the same change. That list is exactly what drifted twice before.

  non-alphanumeric run to a single dash, so distinct package names can map to one
  slug and the plugins then share a single admin address — one plugin's detail
  page opens the other's, and host `pluginOverrides` apply to the wrong package.
  No lookup downstream can detect this, because every lookup along that address
  returns a plugin. `resolvePlugins` now refuses to start, naming both packages
  and the slug they collide on.

  It lists the plugins Nextly publishes with a description, category and author, marks the ones already installed, and searches by name, description and tags. A curated row sits above the grid while there is more in the grid than in the row.

  It is discovery only. Installing a plugin means adding a dependency and a line to `nextly.config.ts`, so the directory never writes to your source or changes plugin state. Where a listed plugin is already installed, its own icon and description are shown rather than the directory's copy of them.

  plugin mounts no routes, so `routes` stays empty and the same declarations

  anything.

  authenticated permissions endpoint rather than the public admin-meta payload.

  These are the rows the seeder actually created, which is a different set from
  the declarations: a `publish` or `unpublish` declaration naming a collection
  or single is dropped, because the seeder emits that slug itself and keeps the
  row ownerless. The page now reports what exists rather than what was asked
  for, and it reports nothing at all when the request fails instead of showing
  an empty section.

  The preview-link machinery already shipped — a mint route gated by `update`, an admin service, a `usePreviewLink` hook and the `PreviewActions` control — but nothing in the standalone editor rendered any of it: the control was wired only into the form footer, which the editor renders in embedded (modal) layouts alone. An author had no way to reach the feature.

  The control now sits in the editor's action bar, directly left of Save, for a saved entry whose author holds `update` on the collection. The permission half of that condition is resolved by the header itself rather than by each caller, so the gate cannot be omitted by a future call site.

Plugin contributions, configured locales, custom sidebar groups and builder availability now come from the session-gated `/api/admin-meta/workspace`, so a plugin-declared permission slug is no longer readable before sign-in.

It observes the migration lock instead of claiming it, so a preview works with a read-only database role, and reports what it could learn about the lock as `lock` on the dry-run outcome rather than refusing when another run is in flight. `lock` is `{ kind: "held", owner }`, `{ kind: "not-held" }` or `{ kind: "unknown", reason }` — an unreadable lock table is reported as unknown rather than as nothing holding the lock.

  Because a preview takes no lock, another run can advance between its reads and leave it scoring the plan against a state the database was never in. A dry run now re-reads and retries when that happens, and the outcome carries `basis` to say which answer it ended up with: `{ kind: "reconciled" }` when the plan was scored against the live catalog, or `{ kind: "unreconciled", reason }` when a writer kept moving underneath it. An unreconciled preview still reports every rename the migration declares rather than an empty list, so it can never be mistaken for "nothing to do". Refusals that re-reading cannot clear are ultimately preserved: a torn-shaped but persistent conflict now spends its attempts confirming the database is not moving before the refusal stands, so a conflicted database sees the extra catalog reads that stability check costs.

  search-index manifest.

  The pin rewrites dependency specifiers after the scaffold has generated its
  lockfile, and pnpm turns frozen-lockfile on by default in CI — so the pnpm blog
  leg aborted with ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE before it could build.

  An index manifest that exists but cannot be parsed no longer reads as owning
  nothing. writeFileSync is not atomic, so an interrupted build can truncate it,
  and treating that as an empty ownership list left the previous index in place
  while the status flipped to empty — the search page would load and serve
  unpublished results.

The exclusion is taken before the change plans anything, so a create, an update or a delete either runs against storage nothing is renaming or is refused
  outright — and a change that is refused has written no row and built no table of its own. Taking
  the exclusion can still create the migration lock's own table, which is empty, holds no content,
  and would have been created by the next successful change anyway. A database that has never run a migration is covered too: these paths may create the lock table, so a first migration cannot claim it and start renaming underneath a change already in progress.

  Not every way of changing schema is covered yet. The Admin's confirmed apply, the standalone
  schema routes, collections and user fields still write without the exclusion, so they can run
  alongside a storage migration.

  `SearchBar` restated Input's classes instead of composing it, and the copy had drifted twelve ways: no `aria-invalid` or `data-[invalid=true]` handling at all, so a search field could not show an error state; `focus:border-primary` without the `!` Input uses; and no `selection:*` colours, `placeholder:opacity-50` or `disabled:pointer-events-none`. Palette work reached every input except this one, because the border token was named in two places and only one was maintained.

  The field is also `type="search"` now, so assistive technology announces it as one.

  Its `className` reaches the wrapper, not the field, so the `border-input` and `border-border` classes eighteen call sites passed were inert. Those are removed, and in development the component now names any it receives so the next one is visible rather than silent.

  That warning judges the class string the element actually receives, and only reports a class that does nothing on the box as rendered: give the wrapper a border and a border colour paints, give it padding and a background shows around the field, and in each case the class is left alone.

  `Input` also sets its own text colour now. It set one for file inputs and for placeholders but never for the field's own text, so it inherited whatever surrounded it — which Tailwind's preflight resets to `inherit` on form controls.

  Thirteen places in the admin held the same two lines: set the page size, return to page one. The copy that drifted meant choosing a larger page size from a later page asked for rows past the end of the list, and the table rendered its empty message over a list that had rows.

  `usePagination` owns page and size together, so the resets travel with the state rather than with each caller: a size change returns to the first page, and `resetPage` covers a search or filter change that alters which rows exist. Both settings move in one update, so a query keyed on them refetches once rather than once per setter. `useServerTable` derives from it rather than restating it.

- [#721](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/721) [`a398047`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/a398047976af71559a5f9a1bb5a44014926e421d) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Tabs now look the same everywhere.

  The admin's tab strips are an underline control: the active tab is marked by a
  bottom border, and the tab is square so that border runs flush to its edges. The
  shared component already draws all of it — the underline, the active and hover
  colours, the focus ring.

  Several first-party plugin screens were drawing their own instead. The form
  builder switched the underline off and repainted it from React state through an
  inline style, three field-editor tabs restated the whole indicator, and a few
  places re-declared a square corner the component already guarantees. The result
  was the same component wearing a different appearance depending on the screen.

  Those screens now pass layout only and let the component draw the indicator, so
  the page builder's inspector, the form builder, its field editor, its preview
  and its submissions list all match the rest of the admin. Layout overrides stay
  allowed, because a tab strip in a dialog is a different shape from one in a
  sheet.

  A test reads every first-party call site and reports one that repaints the
  indicator, so the next screen to do it is caught in review rather than noticed
  later. It reads what a call site is written as, which is not the same as
  guaranteeing the appearance cannot be forked: a class arriving from another
  module, through a prop spread, or through a slotted child is not something it
  can see. The component stays deliberately overridable so a theme can move these
  values, and that is the same door a call site can walk through.

  `DataTableView` resolved its footer slot as `pagination ? pager : footer`, on the reasoning that two pagers in one slot is not a composition anyone wants. But `footer` takes an arbitrary node rather than a pager: a caller using it for a selection summary or bulk actions and then adopting `pagination` lost that content, with both props public, both permitted by the type, and nothing reporting the loss. Both render now, footer first, since a summary describes the rows above it and the pager moves between them.

  Also removes a comment in the media library that explained the grid pager's accessible label by what a source-level placement guard needed. That guard was deleted in the same release, so the comment described nothing; the screen-reader reason is the real one and is kept.

- [#828](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/828) [`e5e4023`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/e5e40239f4f577d0171a981a34c0b83daa024b26) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Tabs gain `TabsList variant="ghost"` and `TabsTrigger size="sm"`, so the compact tab appearance is named rather than spelled out in `className` at each call site. The two call sites that hand-rolled the ghost list disagreed on its height (`h-8` and `h-7`); the variant settles it at `h-8`.

- [#778](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/778) [`d3e487a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/d3e487a85d8918cc7ed393bdb4d5c9d5b82547fd) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Store the configuration a provider parsed, and refuse a write whose parse is not a fixed point.

  The service persisted whatever the caller submitted while the adapter closed over the parse result, so every difference between the two became a defect somewhere that read the row. It now persists the parsed value, and checks before writing that parsing the stored form returns the stored form -- rejecting a `parseConfig` that derives a credential, returns a value JSON cannot carry, or refuses its own output, each of which would otherwise hand the adapter a configuration nobody saved.

A watcher stopped with Ctrl-C left a tsup.<name>.config.bundled\_\*.mjs behind that no ignore rule covered, and the next lint failed with a parsing error naming a file nobody wrote.

- [#750](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/750) [`36825d4`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/36825d4816a2d706a7a39c78986ba8a99120f8b8) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Start both build watchers of `@nextlyhq/ui` on every platform. The `dev` script used a POSIX
  background-and-wait, which `cmd.exe` runs sequentially, so on Windows the first watcher held the
  line and the server-safe artifacts were never rebuilt — with no error, no exit code and no output.

- [#741](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/741) [`02ade17`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/02ade17719d38ed68b062b582f2fea5835ddb33a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Convert `packages/ui`'s build scripts to TypeScript and delete the hand-written
  declaration files beside them. Nothing kept a `.d.mts` in step with the module
  it typed, so a test compared the two — and that comparison had to model every way
  ECMAScript can publish a name. There is no second list to drift now, and the
  scripts are type-checked for the first time.

- [#803](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/803) [`40dfd52`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/40dfd52196a6ac4ea03352665a1c8a0654bbf048) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - fix(nextly): paginate users by user rather than by role-joined row

  listUsers applied LIMIT/OFFSET to a query that left-joined user_roles and roles
  and grouped afterwards, so a user holding three roles consumed three rows of the
  page. A page of N therefore returned fewer than N users, and OFFSET advanced
  over joined rows rather than users — which skipped users entirely rather than
  merely short-filling the page. Measured on nine users with two holding three
  roles each: walking every page visited six of them.

  The page query now selects one row per user and roles are fetched for exactly
  the users that page selected, so total keeps counting the same thing it always
  did and a page of N contains N distinct users. Role order per user is now
  deterministic; the join left it to the planner.

A document JSON writes but rewrites - an array hole, a dropped key, a negative zero - is no longer refused as having no stored form, and a document the validator declined to read is reported as unmeasured rather than as unwritable.

### Patch Changes

- [#734](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/734) [`193d5ec`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/193d5ecdda826cce47832026299242fefd5bfa29) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Advertise the Node range this project actually supports. Every package declared
  `>=20.0.0` while the repository requires `^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0 || >=24.0.0`, so
  installs on 20.6-20.18 or on 23.x succeeded without warning and failed later at
  runtime. Release preflight now derives the expected range from the root manifest
  and rejects a package that disagrees, so the two cannot drift apart again.

- [#722](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/722) [`696281d`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/696281d123832fb1a4a39e4aaf7d27ed085e35a6) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Field group instances now report their stored type through `nextly/field-group-type`, a new entry point that reads whichever spelling a document carries and writes the current one. The admin editor uses it, so content saved before and after the storage rename stays readable and selectable in both.

- [#725](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/725) [`73885c6`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/73885c682f74612fef4fe62122dcacee33267d14) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The field-group storage migration can now report what it would rename without changing any content or recording that a run happened, and refuses to run for real unless the caller states that a restorable backup exists. A preview still claims the migration lock, so it needs a role that can write to Nextly's own lock table.

- [#730](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/730) [`6683ef3`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/6683ef387595684355bba1e02c128f76df5624d6) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Plugin icons now resolve through one shared rule, so the same plugin shows the same icon everywhere in the admin, and a plugin can ship its own logo image instead of naming a built-in glyph.

  The SEO plugin now describes itself in the plugins list instead of showing a bare package name.

  A styling fixture used only by the end-to-end suite no longer appears as an installed plugin, and no longer injects a showcase section into the Posts collection list, in a normal development server.

- [#740](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/740) [`db7122d`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/db7122d484e841a087827babcaff402c0711da0c) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - `@nextlyhq/plugin-sdk` now exports `pluginAdminSlug`, `PLUGIN_CATEGORIES` and `isPluginCategory` (experimental), so a plugin author can derive a plugin's admin slug and check a category against the vocabulary `definePlugin` accepts, rather than reimplementing either. They are also on `nextly` and `nextly/config` for host apps.

  The admin uses those exports instead of its own copies. It previously derived a plugin's URL slug with its own implementation of core's algorithm, so a plugin page could be linked at one slug and routed at another the moment either side changed, and it kept its own list of valid categories, so it could reject a category `definePlugin` accepts.

  Nothing changes in the admin UI. The plugin directory that consumes these is not built yet; this is the groundwork it needs.

- [#727](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/727) [`53fca3e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/53fca3e4fa89ec7c6f116f25f4b01263f6e6995d) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - On desktop, the Plugins item in the admin sidebar now opens the plugins page when you click it, instead of only expanding the sub-sidebar and leaving you to find the page yourself. On mobile it still opens the panel, as every sidebar section with a panel does, and Installed Plugins is the first entry inside it. The item also stays visible when no plugins are installed, so a new project can reach the plugins page at all.

  Users who can read a plugin's collections but cannot manage settings keep the sub-sidebar, since the plugins page itself is settings-guarded.

  The secondary sidebar now closes when the category it is showing stops being one of the sidebar's destinations, so a slow or failing permissions load no longer leaves an empty panel open beside the page.

- [#724](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/724) [`35ff30a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/35ff30a7ed36f7c498aaed68d8dfbbaa95d14547) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - A page whose stylesheet is reused now keeps it when a block migration turns a
  condition-gated node into one that renders nothing. Those nodes never had rules
  in the shared sheet, so withholding it cost every other block on the page its
  styling.

- [#673](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/673) [`67082d1`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/67082d1004fb7d00a63c3d18b83dbf22f9e28ec0) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Check the built server-safe entry points against what the build recorded, and stop publishing the
  bundler metafiles those checks read.

  The gate reads two records the build already wrote — the module specifiers surviving in each
  artifact and every chunk reachable from it, and the bundler's own metafile of what it inlined. A
  bundled dependency leaves no import to find, so the text alone cannot answer what an artifact
  reaches. The metafiles are build inputs to that check rather than something a consumer needs, so
  they are excluded from the published files.

- [#731](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/731) [`298d41e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/298d41ee1efa2e800fa7ebc755d065930e5cf629) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Page builder inspector: keep the open panel tab in sync when the selected block changes type, so the inspector no longer shows a tab the block does not have.
