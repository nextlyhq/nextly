/**
 * The one place a frame's inset is READ from the DOM.

 * exercised without a browser. That leaves one question it cannot answer, and
 * it is the question every caller gets wrong: which measurements add up to the
 * offset between a frame's border box and its content viewport.
 *
 * Answering it in prose did not work. The contract was documented as
 * `clientLeft`/`clientTop`, three call sites followed that recipe, and all
 * three were wrong by the padding — because an iframe's nested viewport begins
 * at the CONTENT box, so padding displaces it exactly as a border does. A
 * recipe a caller applies is a recipe a caller can misapply; a function they
 * call is not.
 *
 * Kept in its own module rather than folded into `geometry.ts` so that the
 * arithmetic stays testable without a DOM. This is the edge; that is the pure
 * part.

 * makes it the same space an absolutely positioned child of the root resolves
