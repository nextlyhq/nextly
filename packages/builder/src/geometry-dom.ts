 *
 * Answering it in prose did not work. The contract was documented as

 * three were wrong by the padding — because an iframe's nested viewport begins
 * at the CONTENT box, so padding displaces it exactly as a border does. A
 * recipe a caller applies is a recipe a caller can misapply; a function they
 * call is not.

 * arithmetic stays testable without a DOM. This is the edge; that is the pure
 * part.
