/**
 * The editor shell, published as its own entry because it is a CLIENT one.
 *
 * The shell is a client component, and Rollup drops per-module `"use client"`
 * directives while bundling, so the directive has to be re-applied to the built
 * file as a banner. A banner applies to the WHOLE artifact and to everything it
 * re-exports — which is why this is a separate entry rather than part of the
 * root barrel.
 *
 * Put in the root barrel, the shell's banner would have marked the frame
 * geometry as client-only too. Those helpers are plain arithmetic that a Server
 * Component is meant to be able to call, and they were part of this package's
 * public surface before the shell existed, so the banner would have been a
 * silent regression for anyone already importing them: the export map would go
 * on advertising a callable function while the artifact delivered a client
 * reference. Splitting the entry keeps the boundary where the React actually is.
 *
 * The props type is still described from the root entry — a type is erased, so
 * it carries no boundary with it.
 *
 * @module @nextlyhq/builder/shell
