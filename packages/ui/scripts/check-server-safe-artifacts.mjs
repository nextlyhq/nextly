/**
 * Verify that a server-safe entry point, as BUILT, runs on a server.
 *
 * The directive guard next to this one answers a different question: whether the artifact carries
 * a `"use client"` banner. An artifact can be free of that banner and still be unusable from a
 * Server Component, because the banner is not what breaks it — importing React is, or touching
 * `document` while the module body evaluates.
 *
 * This reads the BUILT files rather than the sources, and that is the point. A source scan has to
 * predict what the bundler will do: which specifier a bare import resolves to, whether an
 * extensionless path picks the `.ts` or the `.tsx`, whether a folded expression like
 * `import("re" + "act")` reaches React, which type-only imports are erased. Every one of those is
 * already decided here. What is left is a short, finite list of external specifiers, and a file
 * that either evaluates under Node or does not.
 *
 * Two questions, one per way of crossing the boundary:
 *
 * 1. **Does it evaluate?** The artifact is imported into this process, which is Node with no DOM.
 *    A module reading `document` where its body runs throws, and nothing has to recognise the
 *    spelling of the read for that to happen. This is the complete answer to the browser-global
 *    question, in place of enumerating globals and the syntax that dereferences them.
 *
 * 2. **What does it reach?** Every module specifier surviving in the artifact must be on the
 *    allow-list. First-party code is bundled in, so what remains is exactly the external packages,
 *    and JSX has already become a `react/jsx-runtime` import by the time it gets here.
 *
 * The residual gap, stated rather than implied: an ALLOWED package could itself grow a React
 * dependency, and importing React under Node does not throw, so neither question would notice.
 * The allow-list is two pure string utilities and every addition to it is a deliberate decision,
 * which is the control on that.
