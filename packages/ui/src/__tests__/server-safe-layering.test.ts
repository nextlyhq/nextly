/**
 * A server-safe entry point must stay reachable from a server component.
 *
 * `published-entries.mjs` declares which subpaths are server-safe, the build routes those through a
 * config that adds no `"use client"` banner, and a guard asserts the built artifact carries none.
 * None of that looks at what the source IMPORTS — so adding `useState` to `lib/utils.ts` would
 * build cleanly, ship without a banner, and break the first server component to import
 * `@nextlyhq/ui/utils`, with every existing check green.
 *
 * The dependency graph cannot answer this the way it can for a package that is simply not a
 * dependency: `react` is a declared peer dependency of this package and resolves fine. What makes
 * an entry server-safe is that nothing it REACHES pulls in a client runtime, which is a property of
 * the import graph and has to be walked.
