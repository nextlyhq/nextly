### Patch Changes

- [#269](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/269) [`091ec3a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/091ec3a39f3c01621c8a01dfea61b05a7ae689f4) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - `nextly migrate` now works on PostgreSQL.

  Nextly compares the database it finds against the schema it expects, and refuses to continue if the difference looks like it could destroy data. One comparison was wrong: a column holding a list of values, such as the tags on a media item, was described as a plain value on one side and as a list on the other. Nextly read that as someone having changed the column's type, treated it as destructive, and stopped.

  Because the check runs before anything else, this blocked the whole command on every PostgreSQL project, including a database Nextly itself had just created. The only documented way past it was a flag that permits destructive changes, which in this case would have rewritten the column and lost the values in it.

- [#270](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/270) [`6126db4`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/6126db4a7ef4afd9ba07146e604168d28d8d22e9) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Security events are recorded again.

  The audit log stores failed sign-in attempts, rejected requests, and account changes such as a password being changed or a role being assigned. Events that carry extra detail, such as a rejected request or a failed sign-in, were being dropped on SQLite: the detail is stored as text there but as a structured value on PostgreSQL and MySQL, and the wrong one was being sent. The write failed, and because a failed audit write is deliberately not allowed to interrupt whatever the user was doing, nothing surfaced.

  The effect was a log that looked healthy while missing exactly the entries worth reading. Routine events carry no detail and were saved normally; failed sign-ins and rejected requests carry detail and were not. Anyone reviewing that log after a suspicious event would have seen ordinary account activity and no sign of the attempt.

- [#266](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/266) [`fe6734f`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/fe6734fec8772d8cf012598f8abce839dbc29945) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - CLI commands now explain why they failed.

  Errors carry two messages: a safe one for the browser and a detailed one for whoever is running the code. The CLI was printing the safe one, so a failed `nextly db:sync` said only "An unexpected error occurred." with no table, no query and no cause. The same command now reports the failing query and the database's own explanation, for example `no such column: "localized"`, which is usually the whole answer. Full stack traces remain behind `DEBUG=1`.

  A crash inside Nextly is also no longer reported as a validation error. Creating or updating a collection returned HTTP 400 "Validation failed" when the real cause was a defect in Nextly itself, sending people to search their own payload for a problem that was never there. Those now return 500, so the two cases can be told apart.

- [#277](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/277) [`37c221f`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/37c221f9159745d9fd70f7e004c54011d561bbe6) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Schema reconcile now converges, and SQLite no longer loses indexes when a table changes.

  Four faults compounded into one. Comparing a primary key's nullability produced a change no `ALTER` can make on SQLite, so it was proposed forever. Comparing a string default compared `'pending'` against `pending`, so every string-defaulted column looked changed, on every dialect. Both kept the reconcile from ever seeing a clean database, and each unnecessary change rebuilt the table — which on SQLite drops its indexes, because the rebuild creates a new table from a schema that never declared them. `nextly_i18n_archive` completed the set: it was declared in the schema the diff reads but missing from the map the apply pushes, so it was proposed on every run and created by none.

  On a real database this took a reconcile from 45 proposed operations to 1, and from 23 to 9 on an older one, where the remainder is the genuine upgrade. Indexes declared for a collection are now re-asserted in the same transaction as the change, so a table cannot commit without them.

- [#267](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/267) [`7811af8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/7811af8c1a031b982d728aa1e895c089c14852fd) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - `nextly db:sync` no longer proposes deleting collections, singles, or components you built in the Schema Builder.

  Content types reach the database two ways: written in `nextly.config.ts`, or created through the Schema Builder, which stores them in the database only. `db:sync` worked out the intended schema from the config file alone, so anything built in the Schema Builder was invisible to it. On SQLite and MySQL the comparison covers the whole database, so those tables were treated as leftovers and lined up to be dropped. The dev server already merged them back in; both now share one implementation of that rule, so they cannot disagree again. If the registry cannot be read, the sync continues with what the config describes and says plainly that Schema Builder content may be flagged.

- [#287](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/287) [`72b0fdf`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/72b0fdff56e56189390fd82326df2c601d4f7c6a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - The access layer now understands publish and unpublish as operations.

  A collection or single may carry an access rule for `publish` and `unpublish`
  the same way it does for `create` or `update`, and the RBAC check accepts them.
  Nothing enforces them on a write yet; this makes the checks expressible so the
  next release can gate publishing on them.

- [#285](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/285) [`32a0475`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/32a04754d3e017052643abc3084431574106ee0e) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Publishing is now its own permission, separate from editing.

  Every collection and single now seeds `publish` and `unpublish` permissions
  alongside its CRUD ones, and the built-in roles use them: an Editor may publish,
  an Author may write but not publish or take content down, and a Viewer may do
  neither. Nothing is enforced by them yet — this release only creates the
  permissions and assigns them, so existing setups behave exactly as before.

- [#271](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/271) [`89649f8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/89649f87de815ce7aa69453c0a6e88534fa3d871) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Nextly now tells you when your database is behind the code.

  Nextly's own tables are created the first time it connects to a database and are not changed after that. When a new version expects a column those tables do not have, nothing added it, and nothing said so: the mismatch surfaced later as an unrelated-looking failure, or as a feature that quietly stopped working, because some of them catch their own errors and carry on.

  Startup now compares the tables it finds against the ones this version expects and, if anything is missing, prints which tables and which columns, along with the command to fix it. It does not change your database; upgrades stay something you run deliberately. A database that is already up to date prints nothing and the check costs a few milliseconds.

- [#273](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/273) [`ec7eeb1`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/ec7eeb1e68d055a8c88904ab824e7335603fe48b) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - `nextly migrate` no longer refuses on SQLite.

  SQLite reports a text primary key as accepting empty values, because only integer primary keys are automatically required. Nextly's own schema treats every primary key as required, so the two descriptions disagreed on every table, and Nextly read that as someone about to make an existing column required. That change can fail on rows already stored, so it is treated as unsafe and the whole command stops.

  The result was that upgrading a SQLite database was blocked by the very columns Nextly created itself, and `nextly migrate` is the documented way to bring a database up to date, so the only route forward was closed.

- [#261](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/261) [`37495ce`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/37495ce22a197862e3d57d2762bf3b7815111550) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Add a stylesheet for using the UI components inside an existing application.

  `@nextlyhq/ui` previously shipped one compiled stylesheet, and it styles the whole page: it includes Tailwind's preflight, which resets headings, lists, form controls and spacing document-wide. That is what a new app wants, and it is why the kit could not be dropped into an app that already has its own design — importing it restyled everything around the components.

  `@nextlyhq/ui/styles.scoped.css` confines every rule to a `.nextly-ui` wrapper, so the components still get the normalised baseline they are built against while the rest of the page keeps its own styling. Put the class on any element and everything inside it is styled; dark mode goes on the same element.

  Selectors are not the only way a stylesheet reaches outside itself, so the scoped sheet also namespaces the three things CSS resolves globally: animation names, so it cannot displace a `spin`, `pulse` or `fade-in` the host defines; Tailwind's internal `--tw-*` property registrations, which would otherwise change the meaning of those names across the whole host document; and the ancestor classes that `dark:` and `group-*:` variants look for, so a `dark` class higher up the host page no longer flips the components into dark utilities while their tokens stay light.

  Overlay components (Dialog, Select, DropdownMenu, Popover, Tooltip, Command) portal to `document.body`, which sits outside that wrapper, so the scoped sheet needs a `PortalProvider` pointing back inside it. The README shows the setup, and `PortalProvider` and `usePortalContainer` are now part of the stable surface because the scoped stylesheet cannot be used correctly without them.

  The plugin styling guide now also explains why a plugin compiles its own CSS ahead of time rather than relying on the host to scan it, and the README documents which of the three stylesheets to reach for.

- [#282](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/282) [`deb3806`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/deb38068116dcb1fc586e2f95d889b448fc73ae1) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Renaming a version now respects the document own access rules.

  A collection or Single can restrict who may edit a particular document, for
  example by allowing only its owner. Someone who could not edit the document
  itself was still able to rename entries in its history, because that check was
  never run on this path. It now is, for both collections and Singles.

- [#280](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/280) [`55c1eb6`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/55c1eb63d4eae9318b2b43e268c8afe521740158) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Restoring a version now handles components embedded inside other components,
  and inside groups, repeaters and dynamic zones.

  A version records which component each of its values came from, so that
  restoring an old version after a field was pointed at a different component
  reports the mismatch instead of writing the old values into the new component.
  That record stopped at the top level: a component nested inside another one
  kept no such record, so the same restore could quietly put the wrong values in
  the wrong place.

  A nested component is now checked against the components its field allows, the
  same way a top-level one already was, so a restore reports the mismatch instead
  of writing the old values into the new component. The record itself is removed
  before the restore is written, so it stays part of the version history and
  never appears in the document.

- [#263](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/263) [`d398b16`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/d398b163b7df0007db753c4beaedcfc99220f030) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - You can now put a document back to an earlier version.

  Opening version history and previewing a version now offers a Restore action, behind a confirm that says what will happen. Restoring writes the document immediately and records the result as a new version, so nothing is lost and a restore made in error is undone by restoring again.

  Restore reuses the ordinary edit permission — anyone who can edit the document can restore it, and every restore records who did it and which version it came from. History rows now show that lineage, along with the language a version was captured in.

  Two limits are reported rather than hidden: values a version never stored, such as passwords, are left as they are; and if the schema has since dropped a field the version held, the restore says which fields it could not bring back.

- [#283](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/283) [`7e74c6e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/7e74c6efab9847c93a72b3aa7c21662642a038ba) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Webhook endpoints can now be registered, changed, disabled, removed and managed over the REST API.

  The delivery engine, fan-out and signing were all built before anything could create an endpoint for them to act on — the only rows that ever reached the table were test fixtures. This adds the management layer they were waiting for and the routes that expose it: an endpoint carries a name, a target URL, the event types it subscribes to, and optional static headers, and it receives its own signing secret at creation.

  A URL is resolved and checked before it is stored, not only before it is called. Delivery already refuses private, loopback and cloud-metadata addresses, but that happens long after whoever typed the URL has moved on, so a mistake shows up as a silent, repeating delivery failure. Checking at registration turns it into an error that can still be corrected.

  Registering or changing an endpoint requires an interactive session and cannot be done with an API key. An endpoint names a URL the server will call and send content to, so it is both a request-forgery and an exfiltration primitive.

  Static header values are not returned when an endpoint is read. Delivery sends those headers verbatim, so they routinely carry a credential for the receiver, and handing that back to anyone allowed to view the configuration would leak it. The header names are still shown, and a write that echoes the placeholder back is rejected rather than stored.

  Reading a signing secret is a separate request that asks for the update permission rather than read. The secret is what proves a request came from this install, so a read-only role that could see it could forge traffic every receiver would trust.

  Disabling an endpoint is kept separate from deleting it. Only one of those is reversible, and an endpoint id tends to end up in someone else's configuration. Disabling also stops deliveries that were already queued: previously it only removed the endpoint from future fan-out, so a retry scheduled by an earlier failure, or an event that fanned out moments before, would keep being POSTed until it succeeded or ran out of attempts. Those deliveries are now ended rather than held, so re-enabling an endpoint does not release a burst of events its receiver has long since stopped expecting.

  Deleting an endpoint also discards its delivery history, because the delivery table's webhook foreign key cascades. Disabling is the option to reach for when the record of what was sent still matters.

  Static headers are checked when they are saved. A header name that is not a valid HTTP token, or a value containing a line break, can never be sent: the delivery path could not tell that apart from a network fault, so it treated it as temporary and retried an endpoint that could never succeed.

  `webhooks` is now a reserved collection slug. Permission identity is action plus resource, so a collection with that slug would have shared the exact permission rows the endpoint routes check, and a role granted the collection's `read-webhooks` could have read endpoint configuration while `update-webhooks` revealed signing secrets. An installation that already has a collection with this slug needs to rename it.

  Deliveries still need a trigger. Nothing runs the drain yet, so a registered endpoint will not receive anything until that lands.

- [#262](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/262) [`79ae48a`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/79ae48a46c68827a152ca86033adf0c125de22cc) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Recorded webhook events are now cleaned up automatically.

  Every content change records an event, including in projects that have not set up any webhooks, so that table would otherwise grow for as long as the project is edited. Events are now removed once they are old enough and nothing is still waiting to deliver them, and delivery attempts are removed sooner than the events they belong to. Cleanup runs when webhooks are processed and, for projects that never process any, alongside ordinary content saves, so it does not depend on a scheduled job. It is bounded, so no single save waits on a large cleanup, and a cleanup that fails can never fail the save it followed.

  How long to keep everything is configurable under `webhooks.retention`, in milliseconds, with `false` anywhere meaning keep forever. Events are kept 30 days by default and delivery attempts 7 days. Events also carry a retention class, so the ones a future audit log depends on can be kept for a year while the rest are cleaned up in days.

- [#281](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/281) [`d13ec0e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/d13ec0e60249b8e511beabf7612bacf995c60dc9) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Webhook signing secrets can now be generated and stored encrypted.

  Delivery signs each request with the endpoint's secret, but nothing could produce one: there was no generator, and the decrypt step the delivery engine depends on had no implementation outside a test stub. This adds that boundary — a `whsec_` secret in the format Standard Webhooks receivers expect, encrypted under `NEXTLY_SECRET` with the same scheme that already protects email provider credentials.

  Storing a signing secret requires `NEXTLY_SECRET` to be set. Unlike provider configuration, which degrades to plaintext when no key is present, a webhook secret is the signing key itself: stored readable, anyone with database access could sign requests your receivers would trust. It fails instead, and says so.

## 0.0.2-alpha.38

### Patch Changes

- [#250](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/250) [`a302fec`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/a302fec09fdd22f59763ce91cfbbfcca0f5fc3c7) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Fix admin links ignoring modifier clicks, and route the admin's remaining framework-specific navigation through its own router.

  Links in the admin panel now behave like normal links: Cmd/Ctrl-click and middle-click open them in a new tab, `target="_blank"` is honored, and links that point outside the admin (such as the Help entry in the account menu, which goes to the documentation site) open properly instead of being rewritten into a dead admin route. Previously every one of these was captured and turned into an in-app navigation.

  Internally, the few remaining places that reached for the host framework's navigation directly — the command palette, the entry list's reading of the URL query string, and one entry page's links — now go through the admin's own navigation, link, and a new query-string hook. The entry list also no longer issues an unfiltered request before its URL filter is applied.

- [#258](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/258) [`1104b2f`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/1104b2fe83ab6a7d940ec38f83bc6c40f6d1817c) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Internal groundwork for viewing a document's history: field values can now be rendered read-only.

  Nothing in the admin reaches this yet, so there is no visible change in this release. It is the display layer the version history drawer will use to show what a document looked like at an earlier point, with a renderer for every built-in field type including the container types the entry list only ever summarised as a count.

- [#260](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/260) [`1f0a3e6`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/1f0a3e6da323d4a3c5d31e8e7fc8fc9f0c97daca) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - You can now see a document's version history from the editor.

  A History control in the entry header opens a panel listing every saved version of the document, newest first, with who saved it and when. Selecting one shows what the document held at that point, field by field, clearly marked as a past state rather than the live one. Long histories page on demand rather than loading at once.

  Available for both collection entries and singles, on any document with versioning enabled. Restoring a version is not part of this change.

- [#254](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/254) [`7a46bd2`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/7a46bd2757900bc0b7676ecc0171f7a0f74d7f30) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Fix custom admin branding colors, which made branded surfaces transparent instead of applying the configured color.

  Setting `admin.branding.colors` did not tint the admin — it broke it. Buttons, the active navigation item, focus rings and the first chart series lost their background entirely and rendered transparent. Removing the setting was the only way back to a working admin, so the feature was effectively unusable.

  The admin's design tokens hold complete colors and are read directly, but branding was still resolving colors to the bare `H S% L%` form an older token scheme expected. That produced an invalid value, which browsers discard. The server-rendered stylesheet that exists to prevent a flash of unbranded color had drifted further still, targeting a CSS class the admin no longer renders and writing token names nothing reads, so it had no effect at all.

  Branding now resolves to complete colors on both paths, and the server-rendered rule targets the class the admin actually uses, so configured colors appear immediately on load without a flash.

- [#244](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/244) [`40fc723`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/40fc723578f49759310804536a3cacfc51353935) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Fix plugin admin pages 404ing on a direct link or page refresh.

  A page contributed by a plugin (via `contributes.admin.pages`) showed the admin's "Page Not Found" screen when opened by its URL directly — a deep link, a bookmark, or a hard refresh — even though reaching it by clicking within the admin worked. Plugin page routes register just after the admin loads its plugin metadata, which is later than the router's one-time initial route resolution, so that first resolution ran before the routes existed and never re-ran. The admin now re-resolves the current route once plugin pages are registered, so a directly-loaded plugin page renders instead of 404ing.

- [#255](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/255) [`93a432c`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/93a432cfff275f423f545ccc8d21324b55c1f3cd) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Make `@nextlyhq/ui` usable as a published package: components now work in a Next.js app, and plugins stay on one shared copy.

  Importing a component from `@nextlyhq/ui` into a server-rendered page failed, because the published bundle lost the `"use client"` marker that tells React these components run in the browser. The marker now ships with the package, and the build fails if it ever goes missing again.

  `@nextlyhq/ui` also becomes a peer dependency of `@nextlyhq/admin` rather than a bundled one. This is what the plugin documentation already described: the admin and every plugin share a single copy, so components cannot end up talking to a second, isolated instance of the design system. Projects created by `create-nextly-app` already install it, so no change is needed there; a project that added `@nextlyhq/admin` by hand should add `@nextlyhq/ui` alongside it.

  Plugins now depend on a compatible _range_ of `@nextlyhq/ui` instead of one exact version, so a plugin keeps working across releases instead of breaking on every one.

  Also: the documented `@nextlyhq/ui/tailwind-preset` entry point now exists (previously the import failed), the package declares which files have side effects so bundlers can drop unused components, and the plugin styling guide no longer names a CSS class and design tokens that do not exist — following it produced styles that silently did nothing.

- [#256](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/256) [`7c93a64`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/7c93a642495f0b5d04fc2b7a71a755cacfda8ec6) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Content version history is now available from the main API, at
  `/collections/{slug}/entries/{id}/versions` and `/singles/{slug}/versions` (add
  `/{versionNo}` for one version). Reading a document's history requires the same
  permission as reading the document itself, and a version's stored content is
  filtered the same way a normal read would filter it.

- [#257](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/257) [`c092cb0`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/c092cb0a92023b62e88d9db5f057b368b28329ee) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Version history now says who made each change.

  Reading a document's version history previously returned only the raw user id of whoever wrote each version, so a history view had nothing to show but an identifier. Each version now carries the display name of its author, resolved in a single batched lookup.

  The projection is a name only, deliberately not an email address, so reading history does not require permission to read users. Attribution never fails a history read: a deleted user, or an unavailable lookup, leaves the version unattributed rather than erroring.

- [#252](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/252) [`cac7062`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/cac706295f4e0ac42f8f77ee854cdcc645e9e4a1) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Content version history can now be read, and it no longer grows forever.

  Two new endpoints list a document's versions and fetch a single one, and the same
  surface is available to plugin code. Listing returns metadata only, so opening a
  long history never transfers the stored content.

  Version history is also bounded now. A collection or single keeps the number of
  versions you configured instead of accumulating one for every save ever made; the
  limit was previously accepted in configuration but never applied. The newest
  version and the version matching your currently published content are always
  kept, and trimming happens as part of the same save, so history can never be left
  in a half-trimmed state.

- [#243](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/243) [`b5ecec8`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/b5ecec8b14844dc8f7a2d643ae2e693df03d49cc) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Webhook deliveries are now sent, signed, and retried.

  The delivery engine claims each due webhook delivery, signs the request with Standard Webhooks HMAC headers, sends it over the SSRF-safe transport, and records the outcome. A 2xx marks the delivery sent; a 429 or 5xx is retried with exponential backoff and full jitter up to an attempt cap; any other response fails permanently. A claimed delivery is leased so a concurrent drain cannot double-send, and the network request never holds a database transaction open. A drain orchestrator runs fan-out and delivery together until nothing is currently due. The scheduled trigger that starts a drain is a later change.

- [#251](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/251) [`aa5a663`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/aa5a6637d70fb1697be7925e7b8dea510984349a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Creating or updating an entry now records a webhook event.

  Entry creates and updates are written to the webhook event outbox inside the same database transaction as the change itself, so an event is never recorded for a write that rolls back and never missed for one that commits. The event carries the document with password and hidden fields removed, and reports which fields changed by comparing against the document as it stood before the write. On a localized collection the translations and per-locale status for the locale being written are included on both sides of that comparison, so a translation nobody touched is not reported as changed and a per-locale publish is reported with the status it actually committed, and the event names the locale it describes so writes to different translations of the same entry can be told apart. Fields are removed by their position in the document rather than by name alone, so a hidden field inside a component no longer removes an unrelated field that happens to share its name. Every event is attributed to whoever performed it: an API key is recorded as the key itself rather than as the user that owns it, a server-side write is attributed to the user it acts for, and an uninitiated write is recorded as the system. Batch writes are not covered yet: entries created through `createMany`, and entries written through the transaction helpers, commit without recording an event. Deletes, status changes, singles, media, users, and form submissions are later changes.

### Patch Changes

- [#240](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/240) [`d349b9e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/d349b9e913ae6f958e4201b6481dfe83cc5cfa5a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Third-party plugins can now style their admin UI.

  The admin stylesheet is precompiled and isolated, so utility classes that live only in an npm-installed plugin were silently dropped. This adds three layers, in order of preference: new `Stack`/`Grid`/`Stat` layout primitives alongside `Card` in the plugin UI kit; a curated, token-driven utility safelist that is always available with no build step; and, for anything beyond that, a per-plugin `admin.styles` stylesheet compiled with the new `nextly-build-admin-css` CLI (`@nextlyhq/admin-css`) and declared via `contributes.admin.styles`. Plugin styling stays scoped under `.nextly-admin` and token-driven (light and dark) by construction — the CLI refuses to emit a stylesheet that would leak into the host page or hardcode a color.
