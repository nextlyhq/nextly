### Patch Changes

- [#240](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/pull/240) [`d349b9e`](https://github.com/nextlyhq/nextly/commit/d349b9e913ae6f958e4201b6481dfe83cc5cfa5a) Thanks [@mobeenabdullah](https://github.com/mobeenabdullah)! - Third-party plugins can now style their admin UI.

  The admin stylesheet is precompiled and isolated, so utility classes that live only in an npm-installed plugin were silently dropped. This adds three layers, in order of preference: new `Stack`/`Grid`/`Stat` layout primitives alongside `Card` in the plugin UI kit; a curated, token-driven utility safelist that is always available with no build step; and, for anything beyond that, a per-plugin `admin.styles` stylesheet compiled with the new `nextly-build-admin-css` CLI (`@nextlyhq/admin-css`) and declared via `contributes.admin.styles`. Plugin styling stays scoped under `.nextly-admin` and token-driven (light and dark) by construction — the CLI refuses to emit a stylesheet that would leak into the host page or hardcode a color.
