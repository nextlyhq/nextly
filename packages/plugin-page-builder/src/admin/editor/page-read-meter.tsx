/**
 * The page reads meter, as the editor's top bar draws it: what the page being
 * edited reads when it is published, against the allowance a published page
 * renders under, warning from 80% of it.
 *
 * ## How the count is made
 *
 * The canvas cannot be counted as it draws: it keeps each async block's
 * output for the editor's life, so a draw after a selection reads nothing,
 * and it reads through the admin, where several of a published page's reads
 * are never made. So, a moment after the page last changed, the page is drawn
 * once more, off screen, with nothing kept and a budget of its own, through
 * the published route's own read stages (`countPageReads`, which runs them):
 * the components the page and its Layout place, what its bindings and its
 * conditions read, its lists' day terms, the first read of the list it pages,
 * then the page inside its Layout, as the route draws it.
 *
 * What this module gives the stages is where the editor reads:
 * - the definitions the editor holds, and the Layout it draws the page in;
 * - the bindings and the entry fields the page's conditions check, read by
 *   the canvas bindings route through the published page's own read
 *   (`readBindingSources`) under the reads the page has left at that point,
 *   and what that cost is claimed in the count, so a read past the allowance
 *   is refused where the published page refuses it;
 * - the canvas's lists, read as the canvas reads them.
 *
 * It is counted as the person editing sees the page: lists read their
 * drafts too, where a visitor's read may hold fewer entries. A list's days
 * are compared in UTC unless the page's bindings read the site's zone, since
 * the editor reads no site settings of its own; that read is counted.
 *
 * The blocks that went unread are named by that draw's budget, so the panel
 * can select them.
